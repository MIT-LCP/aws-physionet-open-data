Name: Auditory evoked potential EEG-Biometric dataset
Description: 'This data set consists of over 240 two-minute EEG recordings obtained
  from 20 volunteers. Resting-state and auditory stimuli experiments are included
  in the data. The goal is to develop an EEG-based Biometric system.


  The data includes resting-state EEG signals in both cases: eyes open and eyes closed.
  The auditory stimuli part consists of six experiments; Three with in-ear auditory
  stimuli and another three with bone-conducting auditory stimuli.&nbsp;The three
  stimuli for each case are a native song, a non-native song, and neutral music.'
