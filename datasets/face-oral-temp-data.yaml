Name: Facial and oral temperature data from a large set of human subject volunteers
Description: To evaluate the benefit of implementing standardized deployment and acquisition
  practices in the measurement of elevated body temperature (EBT) with infrared thermographs
  (IRTs), we conducted a clinical study with more than one thousand subjects.&nbsp;
  Subject oral temperatures were measured and facial thermal images captured with
  two evaluated IRTs. Based on the thermal images, temperatures from different locations
  on the face were extracted based on developed method and are listed in six CSV file
  as the open database. All data in these files has been de-identified. Based on these
  data, we published two main clinical study papers, with a focus on IRT effectiveness
  for EBT measurements and metrics for evaluating IRT clinical accuracy, respectively.
  Further analysis of this database can still be valuable.
