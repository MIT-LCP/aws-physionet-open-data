Name: Data Chromatix
Description: "Analysis of biomedical time series plays a key role in clinical management\
  \ and basic investigation. However, most conventional monitors streaming data in\
  \ real-time show only the most recent values, not referenced to past dynamics. The\
  \ proposed visualization method (termed &ldquo;data chromatix&rdquo;) was developed\
  \ to address this challenge by bringing memory of the system&rsquo;s past behavior\
  \ into the current display window.\r\n\r\nThe function DataChromatix.m (version\
  \ 1.0) assigns a color to each data point of a time series. The color is determined\
  \ by the values of a normalized histogram (estimated probability density function)\
  \ computed from a pre-selected segment of the data. The algorithm receives the time\
  \ series as input and generates a video of its colorized version as it would look\
  \ on a typical monitor display, as well as a static graph of the entire colorized\
  \ signal."
