Name: eICU Collaborative Research Database Demo
Description: This project is a demo version of the eICU Collaborative Research Database,
  a multi-center database comprised of deidentified health data for over 200,000 admissions
  to ICUs across the United States between 2014-2015. The database includes vital
  sign measurements, care plan documentation, severity of illness measures, diagnosis
  information, and treatment information. Data is collected through the Philips eICU
  program, a critical care telehealth program that delivers information to caregivers
  at the bedside. This open access demo allows researchers to ascertain whether the
  eICU Collaborative Research Database is suitable for their work. It includes over
  2,500 unit stays selected from 20 of the larger hospitals in the eICU Collaborative
  Research Database.
