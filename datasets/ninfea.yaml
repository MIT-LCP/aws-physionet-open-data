Name: 'NInFEA: Non-Invasive Multimodal Foetal ECG-Doppler Dataset for Antenatal Cardiology
  Research'
Description: 'The development of algorithms for the extraction&nbsp;of the foetal
  ECG (fECG) from non-invasive recordings&nbsp;is hampered by the lack of publicly-available
  reference datasets,&nbsp;which could be used to benchmark different algorithms while
  providing a ground truth on the foetal heart activity when an&nbsp;invasive scalp
  lead is unavailable.&nbsp;By enriching the electrophysiological recordings with
  simultaneous multimodal signals, these datasets could also help the investigation
  of the foetal cardiac physiology, providing ground truth for the analysis in early
  pregnancy, when the fECG is not directly accessible.


  The Non-Invasive Multimodal Foetal ECG-Doppler Dataset for Antenatal Cardiology
  Research (NInFEA)&nbsp;is the first open-access dataset featuring simultaneous non-invasive
  electrophysiological recordings, fetal pulsed-wave Doppler (PWD) and maternal respiration
  signals. The dataset includes 60 entries from 39 voluntary pregnant women, between
  the 21st and the 27th week of gestation. Every entry is composed of 27 electrophysiological
  channels (2048 Hz, 22 bits, acquired by means of the TMSi Porti7 system), maternal
  respiration signal (through a resistive thoracic belt), synchronised foetal trans-abdominal
  PWD and clinical annotations provided by expert clinicians at the time of the signal
  collection.'
