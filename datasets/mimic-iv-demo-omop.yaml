Name: MIMIC-IV demo data in the OMOP Common Data Model
Description: In this project, the MIMIC-IV demo database was used to create an Observational
  Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) Common Data Model (CDM) instance. The transformation
  was built making use of template scripts and concept mappings from a previous project
  for converting MIMIC-III data to the OMOP CDM, while adjusting the logic and extending
  the mappings to be compliant with MIMIC-IV. The desired outcome was to establish
  and improve ways of transforming observational data collected in an intensive care
  environment to the OMOP CDM.
