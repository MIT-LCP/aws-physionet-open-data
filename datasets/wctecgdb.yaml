Name: Wilson Central Terminal ECG Database
Description: 'The Wilson Central Terminal ECG Database (WCTECGdb)&nbsp;contains the&nbsp;Wilson
  Central Terminal (WCT), the voltage of right arm (RA), left arm (LA) and left leg
  (LL), six unipolar chest leads&nbsp;associated with three limb leads and six precordial
  leads.


  With our ECG device, the potentials of RA, LA, LL and six true unipolar leads are
  measured using the right leg as the reference point.&nbsp;Having this configuration,
  we have been able to overcome the difficulty of recording the WCT in a clinical
  setting. Our data confirmed once again that the WCT does not have a small value,
  and could be as high as 241% of lead II and has standard ECG characteristics such
  as the p-wave and the t-wave. The dataset comprises of 540 ten-second segments recorded
  from 92 patients.'
