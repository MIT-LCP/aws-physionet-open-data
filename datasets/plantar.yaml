Name: Modulation of Plantar Pressure and Muscle During Gait
Description: Modulation of plantar pressure and muscle during gait was acquired to
  investigate the influences of electrical stimulation (ES) of the tibialis anterior
  (TA) on plantar pressure and the gastrocnemius medialis (GM) activity during gait
  in healthy adults. The database consists of plantar pressure distribution and two
  muscles activity during gait from 20 healthy male adults. We evaluated the activities
  of gastrocnemius medialis and lateralis during gait in the preliminary study, and
  observed that gastrocnemius medialis is more sensitive to gait. Therefore, we recorded
  GM and TA in this study. Only subjects who do not have any history of either neurological
  or orthopedic impairments were included..
