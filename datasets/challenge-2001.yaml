Name: 'Predicting Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter: The PhysioNet/Computing
  in Cardiology Challenge 2001'
Description: Following the success of the first Computers in Cardiology Challenge,
  we are pleased to offer a new challenge from PhysioNet and Computers in Cardiology
  2001. The challenge is to develop a fully automated method to predict the onset
  of paroxysmal atrial fibrillation/flutter (PAF), based on the ECG prior to the event.
  The goal of the contest is to stimulate effort and advance the state of the art
  in this clinically significant problem, and to foster both friendly competition
  and wide-ranging collaborations.
