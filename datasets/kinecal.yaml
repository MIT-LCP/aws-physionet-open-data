Name: KINECAL
Description: The field of human action recognition has made great strides in recent
  years, much helped by the availability of a wide variety of datasets that use Kinect
  to record human movement. Conversely, progress towards using Kinect in clinical
  practice has been hampered by the lack of appropriate data. In particular, datasets
  that contain clinically significant movements and appropriate metadata. This paper
  proposes a dataset to address this issue, namely KINECAL. It contains the recordings
  of 90 individuals carrying out 11 movements, commonly used in the clinical assessment
  of balance. The dataset contains relevant metadata, including clinical labelling,
  falls history&nbsp;and postural sway metrics. In addition, the recordings were made
  in both the lab and in informal settings.
