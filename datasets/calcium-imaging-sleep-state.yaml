Name: Wide-field calcium imaging sleep state database
Description: A collection of wide-field calcium imaging (WFCI) sleep and wake recordings
  collected from twelve transgenic mice expressing GCaMP6f in excitatory neurons.
  Each mouse underwent a three-hour undisturbed WFCI recording session where wake,
  REM (rapid eye movement) sleep and NREM (non-REM) sleep was recorded. Each WFCI
  recording is manually scored by sleep scoring experts in 10-second epochs as wake,
  NREM or REM by use of adjunct EEG/EMG. The dataset contains annotated WFCI recordings,
  brain mask and the Paxinos atlas used for defining the brain regions. The dataset
  was collected as part of a study evaluating a deep learning-based automated sleep
  state classification method.
