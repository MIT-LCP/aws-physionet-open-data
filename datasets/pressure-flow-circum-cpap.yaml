Name: Pressure, flow, and dynamic thoraco-abdominal circumferences data for adults
  breathing under CPAP therapy
Description: A respiratory pressure, flow, and dynamic circumference (chest and abdominal)
  dataset was collected from 30 healthy adults at the University of Canterbury under
  Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) ethics. Pressure and flow data was collected
  using a bi-directional Venturi, with data combined in post-collection processing.
  Dynamic circumferences were measured using inelastic band tape measures attached
  to rotary encoders capturing expansion and contraction. Data was collected at zero
  end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP) and with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP)
  ventilation, at positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings of 4 and 8 cmH2O.
  Data was also collected over three breath types, in which subjects were instructed
  to breathe normally, to pant as fast as possible, and to breathe as deeply as possible.
  Recording times were set to 65 seconds for normal and deep breathing, and 35 seconds
  for panting trials. Subjects self-determined rest time between trials. A questionnaire
  was used to collect relevant demographic data (sex, height, age, weight, and history
  of smoking or asthma). The dataset was collected to inform and validate model-based
  respiratory monitoring systems, with the ultimate goal of shifting respiratory testing
  from specialist clinical settings to primary care and home settings
