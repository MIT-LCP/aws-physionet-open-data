Name: Wrist PPG During Exercise
Description: This database contains wrist PPGs recorded during walking, running and
  bike riding. Simultaneous motion estimates are collected using both accelerometers
  and gyroscopes to give multiple options for the removal of motion interference from
  the PPG traces. A reference chest ECG is included to allow a gold-standard comparison
  of heart rate during exercise.
