Name: Estimating Activity from Instantaneous Heart Rate
Description: Using only a heart rate time series, it is possible to measure a number
  of features that reflect the level of physical activity. Here we provide software
  for deriving an &quot;activity index&quot; based on measurements of mean heart rate,
  total power of the instantaneous heart rate time series over a given interval, and
  stationarity.
