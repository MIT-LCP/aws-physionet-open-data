Name: CHARIS database
Description: The CHARIS database contains multi-channel recordings of ECG, arterial
  blood pressure (ABP), and intracranial pressure (ICP) of patients diagnosed with
  traumatic brain injury (TBI). The data is contributed by members of the CHARIS project
  which aims to systematize the analysis of relevant physiological signals, and create
  data-driven algorithms to search for potential predictors of acute clinical events
  for patients with acute brain injury.
