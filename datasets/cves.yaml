Name: Cerebral Vasoregulation in Elderly with Stroke
Description: 'This database contains multimodal data from a large study investigating
  the effects of ischemic stroke on cerebral vasoregulation. The cross sectional study
  compared 60 subjects who suffered strokes, to 60 control subjects, collecting the
  following data for each patient across multiple days: transcranial doppler of cerebral
  arteries, 24-h blood pressure numerics, high resolution waveforms (ECG, blood pressure,
  CO2 and respiration) during various movement tasks, 24-h ECG, EMG, and accelerometer
  recordings, and gait pressure recordings during a walking test.'
