Name: A Multi-Modal Satellite Imagery Dataset for Public Health Analysis in Colombia
Description: We introduce a cost-effective public health analysis solution for low-
  and middle-income countries&mdash;the Multi-Modal Satellite Imagery Dataset in Colombia.
  By leveraging high-quality, spatiotemporally aligned satellite images and corresponding
  metadata, the dataset integrates economic, demographic, meteorological, and epidemiological
  data. Employing a single forwards and a forward-backward technique ensures clear
  satellite images with minimal cloud cover for every epi-week, significantly enhancing
  overall data quality. The extraction process utilizes the satellite extractor package
  powered by the SentinelHub API, resulting in a comprehensive dataset of 12,636 satellite
  images from 81 municipalities in Colombia between 2016 and 2018, along with relevant
  metadata. Beyond expediting public health data analysis across diverse locations
  and timeframes, this versatile framework consistently captures multimodal features.
  Its applications extend to various realms in multimodal AI, encompassing deforestation
  monitoring, forecasting education indices, water quality assessment, tracking extreme
  climatic events, addressing epidemic illnesses, and optimizing precision agriculture.
