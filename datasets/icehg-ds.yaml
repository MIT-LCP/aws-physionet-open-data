Name: 'Induced Cesarean EHG DataSet (ICEHG DS): An open dataset with electrohysterogram
  records of pregnancies ending in induced and cesarean section delivery'
Description: The surface electrohysterogram (EHG) has emerged as a promising diagnostic
  tool for non-invasive automated preterm birth prediction. The existing automated
  preterm birth prediction methods rely on the use of uterine EHG records coming from
  spontaneous preterm and term deliveries, and are indifferent to term induced and
  cesarean deliveries. In order to enhance current publicly available pool of term
  EHG records, we developed a new EHG dataset containing 126 30-minute EHG records,
  recorded either early (23rd week), or later during pregnancy (31st week), of those
  pregnancies that were expected to end in spontaneous term delivery, but ended in
  induced or cesarean section delivery. The records were collected at the University
  Medical Center Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia. The dataset includes 38 and 43, early
  and later, induced; 11 and 8, early and later, cesarean; and 13 and 13, early and
  later, induced-cesarean records. This database enables better understanding of the
  underlying physiological mechanisms involved during pregnancies ending in induced
  and cesarean deliveries, and provides more robust and realistic assessment of the
  performance of automated preterm birth prediction.
