Name: A Wearable Exam Stress Dataset for Predicting Cognitive Performance in Real-World
  Settings
Description: Preliminary datasets containing skin conductance recordings where experiments
  involve artificial stimuli are available online. However, recordings of a longer
  duration acquired during real-world cognitive stressors are lacking significantly.
  This&nbsp;dataset seeks to bridge the gap between a body of knowledge concerning
  the human stress response primarily built up on laboratory acquired data, and how
  people&rsquo;s skin conductance fluctuates in reality when they undergo a stressful
  exam experience. The data contains electrodermal activity, heart rate, blood volume
  pulse, skin surface temperature, inter beat interval and accelerometer data recorded
  during three exam sessions (midterm 1, midterm 2 and&nbsp;finals) as well as their
  corresponding grades. The purpose of this dataset is to gauge the influence of stress
  on exam performance.
