Name: PhysioZoo - mammalian NSR databases
Description: 'The PhysioZoo database contains electrocardiographic recordings&nbsp;(ECG)
  taken from multiple types of mammals (dogs, rabbits, mice). Each&nbsp;record is
  provided&nbsp;in 3 different formats: MATLAB (.mat), simple text (.txt), PhysioNet
  (.hea,.dat,.qrs). For each record the following data is available:&nbsp;the raw
  ECG signal, reference (human corrected) R-peak annotations and the signal quality
  annotations. All of the files formats are compatible with the PhysioZoo open source&nbsp;software
  available at physiozoo.com. When the recordings were taken, all the mammals were
  conscious, and no drugs were administered prior to the recordings.'
