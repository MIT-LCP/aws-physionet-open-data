Name: WFDB Software Package
Description: Effective processing and analysis of physiological data requires specialized
  software. We have developed a large collection of such software over the past thirty
  years, and much of it is contained within the WFDB (Waveform Database) Software
  Package. The WFDB Software Package comprises over 70 applications for signal processing
  and automated analysis. A comprehensive collection of documentation, including tutorials
  and reference manuals, is also included in the package. The package is written in
  highly portable C and can be used on all popular platforms, including GNU/Linux,
  MacOS, MS-Windows, and all versions of Unix. The package has also been ported to
  other popular languages, including Matlab and Python.
