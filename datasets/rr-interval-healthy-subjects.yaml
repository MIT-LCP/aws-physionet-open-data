Name: RR interval time series from healthy subjects
Description: 'Heart rate variability (HRV) is mainly controlled by the autonomic nervous
  system (ANS) interacting with receptors on the sinoatrial node (SAN). HRV is influenced
  by many several factors such as chemical, hormonal and neural modulations, circadian
  changes, exercise, emotions, posture, and preload. The heart rate adaptation to
  changing factors is carried out by the activity of a variety of regulatory subsystems
  and results in a complex linear and non-linear time behaviour, which changes with
  age, gender and pathological conditions. Many studies explore an age range of 1-99
  years. This study focused on the development of a database of long-term time series
  of healthy volunteers aged between 1 month and 55 years. '
