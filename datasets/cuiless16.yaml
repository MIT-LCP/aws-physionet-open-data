Name: CUILESS2016
Description: The Concept Unique Identifier (CUI)-less database contains a corpus of
  &quot;CUI-less&quot; concepts taken from the SemEval2015 Task 14 that have been
  assigned CUIs. The annotation process allows assignment of CUIS from any Unified
  Medical Language System (UMLS) semantic group and compositional normalization using
  more than one CUI per disease entity. Concepts are mapped to SNOMED CT as represented
  in the September 2016 version found in Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) 2016AB.
