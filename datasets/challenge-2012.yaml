Name: 'Predicting Mortality of ICU Patients: The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology
  Challenge 2012'
Description: The focus of the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2012 is to develop methods
  for patient-specific prediction of in-hospital mortality. Participants will use
  information collected during the first two days of an ICU stay to predict which
  patients survive their hospitalizations, and which patients do not.
