Name: ERP-based Brain-Computer Interface recordings
Description: "This dataset &mdash; created and contributed by Luca Citi, Riccardo\
  \ Poli, and Caterina Cinel &mdash; was generated as part of a study aimed at identifying\
  \ the factors limiting the performance of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) based\
  \ on event-related potentials (ERPs), in order to improve the transfer rate and\
  \ the usability of these interfaces.\r\n\r\nIn this study, each participant was\
  \ asked to spell a total of 20 characters using a traditional matrix speller (shown\
  \ at left). Each record in the dataset contains the signals, triggers and annotations\
  \ corresponding to a single run, i.e. the spelling of a single character. Target\
  \ characters were randomly chosen before the beginning of the run. Each row and\
  \ column of the standard 6x6 matrix of characters was randomly intensified without\
  \ replacement for 100 ms with a gap of 50 ms, leading to a stimulus onset asynchrony\
  \ (SOA) of 150 ms. During a run, each row and column flashed approximately 20 times.\
  \ During that period, subjects were asked to focus on the target character and to\
  \ mentally count the number of times it was highlighted. From subject 03 onwards,\
  \ subjects were asked to report their final count at the end of the run.\r\n\r\n\
