Name: Lightweight 12-lead ECG viewer for MATLAB
Description: Electrocardiograms (ECGs) provide time-varying measurements of the electrical
  activity of the heart. These signals can provide insights into underlying aspects
  of heart health and disease. Here we provide software for viewing 12-lead ECG files
  (in .txt format) in a form familiar to any clinician or ECG expert, facilitating
  manual measurements of intervals and amplitudes. An executable version of the software,
  without the need for Matlab installation, can be downloaded separately. The input
  file is a 10-second 12 lead ECG text file, the output from the Magellan ECG Research
  Workstation Software Version 2.0 (GE Marquette Medical Systems, USA).
