Name: ECG Effects of Dofetilide, Moxifloxacin, Dofetilide+Mexiletine, Dofetilide+Lidocaine
  and Moxifloxacin+Diltiazem
Description: The ECGDMMLD database contains data from a randomized, double-blind,
  5-period crossover clinical trial in 22 healthy male and female subjects, 18 to
  35 years of age, to compare the electrophysiological response of hERG potassium
  channel blocking drugs with and without the addition of late sodium or calcium channel
  blocking drugs. The 5 treatment periods are 1) dofetilide alone, 2) mexiletine with
  and without dofetilide, 3) lidocaine with and without dofetilide, 4) moxifloxacin
  with and without diltiazem and 5) placebo. During each treatment period, 12 blood
  samples for pharmacokinetic measurements are obtained with matched 12-lead ECG recordings.
