Name: Electrocardiogram, skin conductance and respiration from spider-fearful individuals
  watching spider video clips
Description: 'This project&nbsp;contains electrocardiogram, skin conductance and respiration
  as raw data (unfiltered, unprocessed) recorded from consented, spider-fearful individuals
  using the wearable BITalino biosignal measurement device (PLUX &ndash; Wireless
  Biosignals S.A., Lisbon, Portugal) with the sampling rate set to 100&nbsp;Hz per
  channel having 10-bit resolution.


  All subjects were introduced to the exposure procedure and rationale that is mainly
  based on the principles of the one-session exposure treatment.&nbsp;The main focus
  of this study was to investigate if the use of an HRV biofeedback intervention could
  be a promising therapeutic add-on to exposure therapy for specific phobias. Biosignals
  were&nbsp;collected at the Saarland University (Germany) from July 2017 to July
  2018,&nbsp;and there are 57 subjects in total.


  The dataset may support studies on mental health and psychophysiology related to
  other anxiety disorders, such as fear of flying, social phobia&nbsp;and&nbsp;posttraumatic
  stress disorder.&nbsp;'
