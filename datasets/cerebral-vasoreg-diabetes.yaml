Name: Cerebral Vasoregulation in Diabetes
Description: 'This observational study evaluated the effects of type 2 diabetes on
  cerebral vasoregulation and functional outcomes, measured by blood flow responses
  to hypocapnia and hypercapnia, Valsalva maneuver, head-up tilt, and sit-to-stand
  test. This dataset contains 37 diabetic participants and 49 controls (aged &nbsp;55
  to 75 years) with continuous measurements of cerebral blood flow using transcranial
  Doppler and MRI, heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory parameters, balance,
  walking, laboratory and retinopathy measures. '
