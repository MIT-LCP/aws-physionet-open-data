Name: 'Detecting and Quantifying Apnea Based on the ECG: The PhysioNet/Computing in
  Cardiology Challenge 2000'
Description: 'Obstructive sleep apnea (intermittent cessation of breathing) is a common
  problem with major health implications, ranging from excessive daytime drowsiness
  to serious cardiac arrhythmias. Obstructive sleep apnea is associated with increased
  risks of high blood pressure, myocardial infarction, and stroke, and with increased
  mortality rates. Standard methods for detecting and quantifying sleep apnea are
  based on respiration monitoring, which often disturbs or interferes with sleep and
  is generally expensive. A number of studies during the past 15 years have hinted
  at the possibility of detecting sleep apnea using features of the electrocardiogram.
  Such approaches are minimally intrusive, inexpensive, and may be particularly well-suited
  for screening. The major obstacle to use of such methods is that careful quantitative
  comparisons of their accuracy against that of conventional techniques for apnea
  detection have not been published.


  We therefore offer a challenge to the biomedical research community: demonstrate
  the efficacy of ECG-based methods for apnea detection using a large, well-characterized,
  and representative set of data. The goal of the contest is to stimulate effort and
  advance the state of the art in this clinically significant problem, and to foster
  both friendly competition and wide-ranging collaborations. We will award prizes
  of US$500 to the most successful entrant in each of two events.1'
