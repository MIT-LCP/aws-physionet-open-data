Name: WFDB SWIG
Description: The wfdb-swig package provides interfaces between the WFDB library and
  software written in a variety of other languages, so that such software can have
  access to the full range of capabilities supported by current and future versions
  of the WFDB library. The package provides interfaces for software written using
  Perl, Python, C# (and other .NET languages), and Java. The wfdb-swig package can
  be readily extended for use with other target languages supported by SWIG, such
  as PHP, Ruby, TCL, and several versions of Lisp.
