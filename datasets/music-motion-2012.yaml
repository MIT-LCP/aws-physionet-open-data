Name: MICRO Motion capture data from groups of participants standing still to auditory
  stimuli (2012)
Description: This dataset comprises head motion observations collected as part of
  an experiment in which a group of people were asked to stand still for 6 minutes,
  with the first 3 minutes in silence, followed by 3 minutes with music. Head motion
  was captured in units of mm at 100Hz using a Qualisys infra-red optical system.
  The experiment was carried out at the University of Oslo on March 8th 2012 from
  a total of 113 participants. Code to read and process these files is available.
  The paper corresponding to the work is Jensenius et al., &quot;The Musical Influence
  on People&#39;s Micromotion when Standing Still in Groups&quot;, Proceedings of
  the 14th Sound and Music Computing Conference (2017).
