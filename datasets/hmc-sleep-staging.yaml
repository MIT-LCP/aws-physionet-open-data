Name: Haaglanden Medisch Centrum sleep staging database
Description: A collection of 151 whole-night polysomnographic (PSG) sleep recordings
  (85 Male, 66 Female, mean Age of 53.9 &plusmn; 15.4) collected during 2018 at the
  Haaglanden Medisch Centrum (HMC, The Netherlands) sleep center. Patient recordings
  were randomly selected and include a heterogeneous population which was referred
  for PSG examination on the context of different sleep disorders. The dataset contains
  electroencephalographic (EEG), electrooculographic (EOG), chin electromyographic
  (EMG), and electrocardiographic (ECG) activity, as well as event annotations corresponding
  to scoring of sleep patterns (hypnogram) performed by sleep technicians at HMC.
  The dataset was collected as part of a study evaluating the generalization performance
  of an automatic sleep scoring algorithm across multiple heterogeneous datasets.
