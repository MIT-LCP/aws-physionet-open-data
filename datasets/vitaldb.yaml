Name: VitalDB, a high-fidelity multi-parameter vital signs database in surgical patients
Description: In modern anesthesia, multiple medical devices are used simultaneously
  to comprehensively monitor real-time vital signs to optimize patient care and improve
  surgical outcomes. However, interpreting the dynamic changes of time-series biosignals
  and their correlations is a difficult task even for experienced anesthesiologists.
  Recent advanced machine learning technologies have shown promising results in biosignal
  analysis, however, research and development in this area is relatively slow due
  to the lack of biosignal datasets for machine learning. The VitalDB (Vital Signs
  DataBase) is an open dataset created specifically to facilitate machine learning
  studies related to monitoring vital signs in surgical patients. This dataset contains
  high-resolution multi-parameter data from 6,388 cases, including 486,451 waveform
  and numeric data tracks of 196 intraoperative monitoring parameters, 73 perioperative
  clinical parameters, and 34 time-series laboratory result parameters. All data is
  stored in the public cloud after anonymization. The dataset can be freely accessed
  and analysed using application programming interfaces and Python library. The VitalDB
  public dataset is expected to be a valuable resource for biosignal research and
  development.
