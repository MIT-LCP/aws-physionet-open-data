Name: MIMIC-III Clinical Database Demo
Description: 'MIMIC-III&nbsp;is a large, freely-available database comprising deidentified
  health-related data associated with over 40,000 patients who stayed in critical
  care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012 [1].
  The&nbsp;MIMIC-III Clinical Database is available on PhysioNet (doi: 10.13026/C2XW26).
  Though deidentified, MIMIC-III contains detailed information regarding the care
  of real patients, and as such requires credentialing before access. To allow researchers
  to ascertain whether the database is suitable for their work, we have manually curated
  a demo subset, which contains information for&nbsp;100 patients also present in
  the MIMIC-III Clinical Database. Notably, the demo dataset does not include free-text
  notes.'
