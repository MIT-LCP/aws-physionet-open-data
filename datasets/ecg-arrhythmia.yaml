Name: A large scale 12-lead electrocardiogram database for arrhythmia study
Description: This newly inaugurated research database for 12-lead electrocardiogram
  (ECG) signals was created under the auspices of Chapman University, Shaoxing People&rsquo;s
  Hospital (Shaoxing Hospital Zhejiang University School of Medicine), and Ningbo
  First Hospital. It aims to enable the scientific community in conducting new studies
  on arrhythmia and other cardiovascular conditions. Certain types of arrhythmias,
  such as atrial fibrillation, have a pronounced negative impact on public health,
  quality of life, and medical expenditures. As a non-invasive test, ECG is a major
  and vital diagnostic tool for detecting these conditions. This practice, however,
  generates large amounts of data, the analysis of which requires considerable time
  and effort by human experts. Modern machine learning and statistical tools can be
  trained on high quality, large data to achieve exceptional levels of automated diagnostic
  accuracy. Thus, we collected and disseminated this novel database that contains
  12-lead ECGs of 45,152 patients with a 500&thinsp;Hz sampling rate that features
  multiple common rhythms and additional cardiovascular conditions, all labeled by
  professional experts. The dataset can be used to design, compare, and fine-tune
  new and classical statistical and machine learning techniques in studies focused
  on arrhythmia and other cardiovascular conditions.
