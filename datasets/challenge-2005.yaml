Name: 'The First Five Challenges Revisited: The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology
  Challenge 2005'
Description: "Our popular series of challenges presented in cooperation with Computers\
  \ in Cardiology continues this year in a new mode. Participants are invited to choose\
  \ one of the five previous challenges as a topic for a follow-up study:\n\n\n\t\
  Detecting sleep apnea from the ECG\n\tPredicting paroxysmal atrial fibrillation\n\
  \tRR interval time series modeling\n\tDistinguishing ischemic from non-ischemic\
  \ ST changes\n\tSpontaneous termination of atrial fibrillation\n\n\nThe problems\
  \ posed by these challenges have continued to interest many researchers long after\
  \ the final deadlines have passed. We encourage you to read the papers published\
  \ by previous challenge participants in the Computers in Cardiology proceedings\
  \ and elsewhere, and to build upon this work in pursuit of even better solutions.\
  \ This year, we will recognize the most outstanding papers inspired by a previous\
  \ challenge, with special awards to be presented at Computers in Cardiology.\n\n\
  With knowledge gained from previously published papers, can you advance the state\
  \ of the art further, either by combining efforts with other participants or by\
  \ entirely new methods?"
