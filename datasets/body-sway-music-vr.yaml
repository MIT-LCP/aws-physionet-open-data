Name: Body Sway When Standing and Listening to Music Modified to Reinforce Virtual
  Reality Environment Motion
Description: The increased likelihood of falls as a consequence of aging or disease
  is generally associated with rising levels of body sway during stance.&nbsp; The
  use of virtual reality (VR) for studying the role in vision in regulating body sway
  is well established, however the extent to which music incorporated into a virtual
  environment can influence sway is not understood.&nbsp;This dataset was collected
  as part of a study to explore the&nbsp;hypothesis&nbsp;that music manipulated to
  match VR motion provided by an Oculus Rift head mounted display can lead to increased
  levels of body sway.&nbsp;Twenty-eight subjects stood for 60 s on a balance platform
  that measured anterior posterior (AP) and medial lateral (ML) center of pressure
  movement (indicators of body sway).&nbsp; While standing, the subjects experienced&nbsp;combinations
  of 3 visual conditions (VR translation in the AP direction at 0.1 Hz, no translation,
  and eyes closed) and 4 music conditions (Mozart&rsquo;s Jupiter Symphony modified
  to scale volume at 0.1 Hz and 0.25 Hz, unmodified music, and no music) for a total
  of 12 trials.&nbsp;Analysis of the data using frequency domain measures may reveal
  the extent to which music influenced body sway.
