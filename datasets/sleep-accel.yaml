Name: Motion and heart rate from a wrist-worn wearable and labeled sleep from polysomnography
Description: This project&nbsp;contains acceleration (in units of g) and&nbsp;heart
  rate (bpm, measured from photoplethysmography) recorded from the Apple Watch, as
  well as labeled sleep scored from gold-standard polysomnography. Data were&nbsp;collected
  at the University of Michigan from June 2017 to March 2019,&nbsp;and there are 31
  subjects in total. Code to read and process these files is available on GitHub.
  The paper corresponding to the work is Walch et al., &quot;Sleep stage prediction
  with raw acceleration and photoplethysmography heart rate data derived from a consumer
  wearable device&quot;, SLEEP (2019).
