Name: Two-tiered response of cardiorespiratory-cerebrovascular networks to orthostatic
  challenge
Description: 'The authors used this dataset&nbsp;to evaluate the responsiveness of
  the cardiorespiratory-cerebrovascular networks by capturing linear and nonlinear
  interdependencies to postural changes. Ten young healthy adults participated in
  our study between December 2009 and February 2010 at Semmelweis University, Faculty
  of Medicine. Non-invasive measurements of arterial blood pressure (ABP), cardiac
  cycle duration&nbsp;(derived from ABP signals), breath-to-breath interval (capnography),
  cerebral blood flow velocity (BFV, recorded by transcranial Doppler sonography),
  and cerebral hemodynamics (hemoglobin signals monitored by near-infrared spectroscopy)
  were performed for 30-minutes in resting state, followed by a one-minute stand-up
  and a one-minute sit-down period. BFV and ABP signals were calibrated, and the&nbsp;dataset
  contains values in cm/s and mmHg, respectively. NIRS measurement yielded intensity
  values (raw signals) from which change of HbO (oxyhemoglobin), HbR (deoxyhemoglobin)
  and HbT (total hemoglobin) concentration in tissue can be calculated (in micromol/liter).
  Raw NIRS signals were synchronized to BFV, ABP and capnography time series yielding
  33 minutes of resampled data (sampling frequency: ~ 3 Hz).'
