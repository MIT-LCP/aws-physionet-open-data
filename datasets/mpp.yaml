Name: Multiscale Poincare Plots
Description: Poincar&eacute; delay maps are widely used in the analysis of cardiac
  interbeat interval (RR) dynamics. To facilitate visualization of the structure of
  these complex time series, we introduced a methodology called multiscale Poincar&eacute;
  (MSP) plots.
