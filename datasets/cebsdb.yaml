Name: Combined measurement of ECG, Breathing and Seismocardiograms
Description: "This database contains the combined measurement of ECG, breathing and\
  \ seismocardiogram from 20 healthy volunteers.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the database\
  \ was twofold:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTo check if slight errors in the detection of the RR\
  \ time series when measuring it using two different leads are influenced by breathing.\r\
  \n\tTo compare the RR time series obtained from the ECG and its surrogate measure\
  \ obtained from the seismocardiogram or SCG (and to optimize beat detectors for\
  \ SCG).\r\n"
