Name: A multi-camera and multimodal dataset for posture and gait analysis
Description: 'Gait and posture analysis while using assisting robotic devices is of
  utmost importance to attain effective assistance. This work provides a multi-camera,
  multimodal, and detailed dataset for vision-based applications using a wheeled robotic
  walker equipped with a pair of affordable cameras. Depth data was acquired at 30
  fps from a total of 14 healthy participants walking at 3 different gait speeds,
  across 3 different walking scenarios/paths at 3 different locations. Simultaneously,
  accurate skeleton joint data was recorded using an inertial-based commercial motion
  capture system that provides a reliable ground-truth for classical or novel (i.e.,
  machine learning-based) vision-based applications. In total, the database contains
  approximately 166K frames of synchronized data, which amounts to 92 minutes of total
  recording time. This dataset may contribute to the development and evaluation of:
  i) classic or data-driven vision-based pose estimation algorithms; ii) applications
  in human detection and tracking, and movement forecasting; iii) and gait/posture
  metrics analysis using a rehabilitation device.'
