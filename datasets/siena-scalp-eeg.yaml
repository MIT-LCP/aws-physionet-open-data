Name: Siena Scalp EEG Database
Description: The database consists of EEG recordings of 14 patients acquired at the
  Unit of Neurology and Neurophysiology of the University of Siena.&nbsp; Subjects
  include 9 males (ages 25-71) and 5 females (ages 20-58). Subjects were monitored
  with a Video-EEG with a sampling rate of 512 Hz, with electrodes arranged on the
  basis of the international 10-20 System. Most of the recordings also contain 1 or
  2 EKG signals. The diagnosis of epilepsy and the classification of seizures according
  to the criteria of the International League Against Epilepsy were performed by an
  expert clinician after a careful review of the clinical and electrophysiological
  data of each patient.
