Name: Brno University of Technology ECG Quality Database (BUT QDB)
Description: 'BUT QDB is a&nbsp;database created&nbsp;by the cardiology team at the
  Department of Biomedical Engineering, Brno University of Technology, for the purpose
  of evaluating ECG quality. The data comprises 18 long-term recordings of single-lead
  ECGs and associated 3-axis accelerometer data, collected from 15 subjects (9 female,
  6 male) aged between 21 to 83 years. Recordings were carried out between August
  2018 and October 2019 while the subjects were undertaking ordinary&nbsp;everyday
  activities (&quot;free-living conditions&quot;). Data was collected using a&nbsp;mobile
  ECG and accelerometer (Bittium Faros 180) with a&nbsp;sampling frequency&nbsp;of
  1,000 Hz for ECG signals and 100 Hz for accelerometer signals.&nbsp;The minimum
  length of recording is 24 hours.&nbsp;


  Three signals were fully annotated in terms of ECG signal quality. The remaining
  15 signals were annotated in two selected segments, each of 20 minutes in&nbsp;duration.
  Furthermore, five additional segments of poor signal quality were also annotated.
  Signal quality was classified as follows: Class 1 indicates that all ECG significant
  waveforms (P wave, T wave and QRS complex) are clearly visible and their onsets
  and offsets can be detected reliably; Class 2 indicates that the noise level is
  increased and ECG significant points cannot be reliably detected, but the signal
  enables reliable QRS detection; Class 3 indicates that QRS complexes cannot be detected
  reliably and the signal is unsuitable for any further analysis.'
