Name: Sudden Cardiac Death Holter Database
Description: "PhysioNet has inaugurated a Sudden Cardiac Death Database to support\
  \ research and to stimulate progress in this important area of electrophysiology.\
  \ We initiate this database with 23 complete Holter recordings (originally collected\
  \ by Scott Greenwald while he was at MIT), from which half-hour excerpts have been\
  \ available to researchers since 1989 as the MIT-BIH Malignant Ventricular Arrhythmia\
  \ Database. The database currently includes 18 patients with underlying sinus rhythm\
  \ (4 with intermittent pacing), 1 who was continuously paced, and 4 with atrial\
  \ fibrillation. All patients had a sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmia, and most\
  \ had an actual cardiac arrest.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;"
