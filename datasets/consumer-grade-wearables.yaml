Name: 'CogWear: Can we detect cognitive effort with consumer-grade wearables?'
Description: 'The CogWear database consists of two datasets: pilot and survey gamification
  experiment.&nbsp;The pilot dataset includes physiological signals from 11 volunteers
  captured by three wearable devices (Empatica E4 watch, Samsung Galaxy Watch4 and
  Muse S EEG headband) during cognitively demanding task (Stroop test) and baseline
  condition (no engagement in any activity). The pilot dataset was collected to evaluate
  the experimental setup and the signal captured by the wearables. In particular,
  can we detect when people perform a cognitively demanding task using data from consumer-grade
  smartwatches.&nbsp;The survey gamification experiment dataset includes physiological
  signal collected from 13 volunteers by three wearable devices (Empatica E4 watch,
  Samsung Galaxy Watch4 and Muse S EEG headband) during two sessions. In both sessions
  participants, as in the pilot study, engaged in a cognitively demanding task then
  rested and did not perform any tasks and finally filled in four mobile surveys related
  to work and wellbeing (GRIT, PANAS, HAPPINES and NFR). The mobile surveys were either
  gamified or not.&nbsp; The volunteers were divided into two groups: group 1 filled
  in gamified surveys in the first session and non-gamified surveys in the second
  session, group 2 had the opposite order. There was a two-week break time between
  the sessions. This dataset was captured to investigate whether simple gamification
  has an impact on the cognitive burden of filling in the surveys.
