Name: Waveform Database Software Package (WFDB) for MATLAB and Octave
Description: Physiological waveforms - such as electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms
  (EEG), electromyograms (EMG) - are generated during the course of routine care.
  These signals contain information that can be used to understand underlying conditions
  of health. Effective processing and analysis of physiological data requires specialized
  software. The WaveForm DataBase (WFDB) Toolbox for MATLAB and Octave is a collection
  of over 30 functions and utilities that integrate PhysioNet&#39;s open-source applications
  and databases with the high-precision numerical computational and graphics environment
  of MATLAB and Octave.
