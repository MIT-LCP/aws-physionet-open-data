Name: Pulse Transit Time PPG Dataset
Description: We provide an open access, high resolution and time synchronised dataset
  from multiple sensors worn at different body locations including Photoplethysmogram
  (PPG), Inertial, Pressure and ECG. The recordings are from 22 healthy subjects performing
  3 physical activities. This dataset contains 66 waveform records from multi-site
  and multi-wavelength PPGs, sensors&rsquo; attachment pressures, sensors&rsquo; temperatures,
  inertial data from accelerometer and gyroscope, along with annotated ECG data for
  a total of 19 channels. Additionally, systolic and diastolic blood pressures, as
  well as blood oxygenation saturation levels (SpO2) numerics are provided.
