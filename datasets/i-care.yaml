Name: 'I-CARE: International Cardiac Arrest REsearch consortium Database'
Description: The International Cardiac Arrest REsearch consortium (I-CARE) Database
  includes baseline clinical information and continuous electroencephalogram (EEG)
  and electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings from comatose patients following cardiac
  arrest. The patients were admitted to an intensive care unit (ICU) in one of seven
