Name: A Pressure Map Dataset for In-bed Posture Classification
Description: In this project, we collected in-bed posture pressure data from multiple
  adult participants using two different types of pressure sensing mats. To the best
  of our knowledge, our dataset, PmatData is the first publicly-available dataset
  of pressure sensor data which includes various sleeping postures. PmatData contains
  pressure data from two separate experiments.
