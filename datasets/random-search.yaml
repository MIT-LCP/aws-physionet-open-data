Name: Random Search Toolbox
Description: A major issue with many signal processing and machine learning algorithms
  is the lack of optimisation methods for determining the numerous hyper-parameters
  associated with the model as well as the knowledge of which hyper-parameters are
  relevant. These parameters are usually tunned by trial and error (manual search)
  or by grid search. In 2012 Bergstra et al. showed empirically that random search
  was performing similar or better than grid search while reducing the computational
  cost substantially.
