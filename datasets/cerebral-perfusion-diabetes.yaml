Name: Cerebral perfusion and cognitive decline in type 2 diabetes
Description: 'This dataset was collected as part of a study to explore vasoregulation
  and blood flow in patients with type 2 Diabetes mellitus. It comprises cerebral
  blood, autonomic functions, laboratory and gait variables in 70 patients with type
  2 DM and 70 healthy controls (50-85 years old). Diabetes mellitus is a prevalent,
  costly condition with high morbidity and mortality that affects nearly 6.3% of the
  population in the United States. Diabetes mellitus alters the permeability of the
  blood-brain barrier, thus affecting regional metabolism and microcirculatory regulation.
  Predictors of cerebrovascular complications of diabetes that are evidence-based
  on cerebral blood flow, MRI imaging, and cognitive testing are lacking.


  Blood flow velocities were measured in the anterior and middle cerebral arteries
  using transcranial Doppler ultrasound. Cerebral vasoregulation was evaluated by
  comparing blood flow velocity responses during hypocapnia and hypercapnia, Valsalva
  maneuver, head-up tilt and sit-to-stand test using simultaneous recordings of cardiovascular
  variables, blood flow velocity in the anterior and middle cerebral artery using
  transcranial Doppler and respiratory variables. We applied continuous arterial spin
  labeling at 3 Tesla MRI to evaluate regional distribution of cerebral blood flow
  and vasomotor reactivity to CO2. Cognitive and executive functions were assessed
  via a battery of psychometric measures. Gait and balance were characterized from
  dynamics of foot pressure distribution and center of pressure displacement.'
