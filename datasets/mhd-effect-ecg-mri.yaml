Name: Influence of the MHD effect on 12-lead and 3-lead ECGs recorded in 1T to 7T
  MRI scanners
Description: This ECG dataset was acquired in different magnetic resonance imaging
  (MRI) scanners to study the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effect. The MHD effect, which
  is caused an interaction of the MRI&rsquo;s strong static magnetic field and the
  patient&rsquo;s blood flow, superimposes the ECG signal during MRI exams. As a consequence,
  a detailed morphological analysis of the ECG (e.g. of the P wave, ST segment or
  the T wave) is prevented. The MHD effect might be a useful signal for extracting
  further physiological information, e.g. about blood flow or stroke volume. The 12-lead
  and 3-lead ECG signals were acquired from different subjects in various MRI scanners
  with magnetic field strengths ranging from 1T up to 7T. All signals were manually
  annotated.
