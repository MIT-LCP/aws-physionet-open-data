Name: 'Classification of 12-lead ECGs: The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge
  2020'
Description: 'The electrocardiogram (ECG) is a non-invasive representation of the
  electrical activity of the heart from electrodes placed on the surface of the torso.
  The standard 12-lead ECG has been widely used to diagnose a variety of cardiac abnormalities
  such as cardiac arrhythmias, and predicts cardiovascular morbidity and mortality
  [1]. The early and correct diagnosis of cardiac abnormalities can increase the chances
  of successful treatments [2]. However, manual interpretation of the electrocardiogram
  is time-consuming, and requires skilled personnel with a high degree of training
  [3].


  Automatic detection and classification of cardiac abnormalities can assist physicians
  in the diagnosis of the growing number of ECGs recorded. Over the last decade, there
  have been increasing numbers of attempts to stimulate 12-lead ECG classification.
  Many of these algorithms seem to have the potential for accurate identification
  of cardiac abnormalities. However, most of these methods have only been tested or
  developed in single, small, or relatively homogeneous datasets. The PhysioNet/Computing
  in Cardiology Challenge 2020 provides an opportunity to address this problem by
  providing data from a wide set of sources.'
