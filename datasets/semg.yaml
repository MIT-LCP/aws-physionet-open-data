Name: Surface electromyographic signals collected during long-lasting ground walking
  of young able-bodied subjects
Description: 'The present dataset is composed of long-lasting (around 5 minutes) surface
  electromyographic (sEMG) signals recorded from 2011 and 2018 during ground walking
  of 31 young (20 years &lt; age &lt; 30 years) able-bodied subjects in the Movement
  Analysis Lab, Universit&agrave; Politecnica delle Marche, Ancona, Italy. Underweight,
  overweight, and obese people (body mass index, BMI &lt; 18.5 Kg/m2 and BMI &gt;
  25 Kg/m2) and subjects affected by any pathological condition, joint pain, or undergone
  orthopedic surgery are not included in the present dataset. sEMG signals are acquired
  from the following ten different leg muscles (five per leg): gastrocnemius lateralis
  (GL), tibialis anterior (TA), rectus femoris (RF), hamstrings (Ham), and vastus
  lateralis (VL). Synchronized footswitch and electrogoniometric data are provided
  in order to allow users to achieve a spatial/temporal characterization of the sEMG
  signals. Data have been acquired in subjects walking barefoot on level ground for
  around 5 min at their natural speed and pace, following an eight-shaped path which
  includes rectilinear segments and curves. The considerable length of the signals
  makes this dataset very suitable for those studies where the numerosity of the data
  is essential, such as machine/deep&nbsp;learning approaches, studies for analyzing
  and quantifying the variability of muscle recruitment during physiological walking,
  and creation of reference dataset in the characterization of pathological&nbsp;conditions.'
