Name: Labeled raw accelerometry data captured during walking, stair climbing and driving
Description: 'The database contains raw accelerometry data collected during outdoor
  walking, stair climbing, and driving for 32 healthy adults. Accelerometry data were
  collected simultaneously at four body locations: left wrist, left hip, left ankle,
  and right ankle, at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz. The 3-axial ActiGraph GT3X+
  devices were used to collect the data. The data include labels of activity type
  performed (walking, descending stairs, ascending stairs, driving, clapping) for
  each time point of data collection. Basic demographic information of participants
  is also provided. All data are anonymized.'
