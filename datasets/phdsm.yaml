Name: Permittivity of Healthy and Diseased Skeletal Muscle
Description: A better understanding of the permittivity of skeletal muscle is essential
  for the development of new diagnostic tools and approaches for neuromuscular evaluation.
  However, there remain important knowledge gaps in our understanding of this property
  in healthy and diseased skeletal muscle, which hinder its translation into clinical
  application. The aim of this project is to provide a platform for the researchers
  to contribute and share the dissemination of this property in healthy and diseased
  muscle. Ultimately, the normative data reported will offer the scientific community
  the opportunity to improve the accuracy of existing techniques as well as developing
  new diagnostic tools and therapies.
