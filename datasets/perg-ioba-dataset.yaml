Name: 'A Comprehensive Dataset of Pattern Electroretinograms for Ocular Electrophysiology
  Research: The PERG-IOBA Dataset'
Description: 'The pattern electroretinogram (PERG) is a valuable tool in ophthalmic
  electrophysiology, offering a non-invasive and objective method to evaluate central
  retinal function. By measuring electrical activity in the macula and retinal ganglion
  cells, PERG provides essential quantitative insights, especially when distinguishing
  between macular and optic nerve diseases remains challenging. This dataset comprises
  1354 transient PERG responses from 304 subjects in 336 records, representing a comprehensive
  collection of ocular electrophysiological data. The evaluations took place at the
  Institute of Applied Ophthalmobiology (IOBA) at the University of Valladolid, Spain,
  from 2003 to 2022. Detailed clinical information, including age, gender, and diagnoses,
  is provided in CSV format. Additionally, the dataset, which guarantees the presence
  of at least one PERG signal for each eye, incorporates visual acuity measurements
  in logMar scale, facilitating assessments of vision quality. Addressing a significant
  gap in ocular electrophysiological signal repositories, this dataset serves as a
  valuable resource for the advancement of ophthalmology research. Researchers can
  explore a wide range of eye-related conditions and diseases, leading to improved
  diagnostic techniques, treatment strategies, and a deeper understanding of ocular
  electrophysiology. '
