Name: Brno University of Technology Smartphone PPG Database (BUT PPG)
Description: 'Brno University of Technology Smartphone PPG Database (BUT PPG) is a
  database created by the cardiology team at the Department of Biomedical Engineering,
  Brno University of Technology, for the purpose of evaluating PPG quality and estimation
  of heart rate (HR). The data comprises 3,888 10-second recordings of PPGs and associated
  ECG signals used for determination of reference HR. All of the signals contain QRS
  complex positions, most signals contain moreover accelerometric data (ACC), and
  single-value annotations of blood pressure, blood oxygen saturation and glycaemia.
  The data were collected from 50 subjects (25 female, 25 male) aged between 19 to
  76 years at rest and during various types of movement. Recordings were carried out
  between August 2020 and December 2021. PPG data were collected by smartphones Xiaomi
  Mi9 and Huawei P20 Pro with sampling frequency of 30 Hz. Reference ECG signals and
  ACC data were recorded using a mobile recorder Bittium Faros 360 or 180 with a sampling
  frequency of 1,000 Hz (ECG) and 100 Hz (ACC). Each PPG signal includes annotation
  of quality and reference HR. PPG signal quality is indicated binary: 1 indicates
  good quality for HR estimation, 0 indicates signals where HR cannot be detected
  reliably and thus these signals are unsuitable for any analysis.'
