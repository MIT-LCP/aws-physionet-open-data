Name: Cerebromicrovascular Disease in Elderly with Diabetes
Description: This dataset was collected as part of a prospective observational study
  to evaluate&nbsp;the effects of type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) on cerebral vasoregulation,
  perfusion and functional outcomes, measured by blood flow responses to hypocapnia
  and hypercapnia, Valsalva maneuver, head-up tilt, and sit-to-stand test. The&nbsp;dataset
  comprises of&nbsp;observations from 69 diabetic and control participants&nbsp;(aged
  55 to 75 years) with continuous measurements of cerebral blood flow using transcranial
  Doppler and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), heart rate, blood pressure, and respiratory
  parameters, balance, walking, laboratory and retinopathy measures at baseline, and
  41 subjects who completed the two-years of follow-up. Regional gray, white matter
  and cerebrospinal fluid volumes were quantified using a segmentation method applied
  on T1- and T2- weighted images and perfusion maps, using a continuous arterial spin
  labeling (CASL) images at 3 Tesla MRI. White matter integrity was determined from
  fluid attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) and diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) MRI.
  Dynamics of cerebral vasoregulation to CO2 challenge and orthostatic stress were
  measured using Transcranial Doppler ultrasound (TCD).
