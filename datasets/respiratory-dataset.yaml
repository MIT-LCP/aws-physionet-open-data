Name: Respiratory dataset from PEEP study with expiratory occlusion
Description: 'A trial was conducted to collect gauge pressure and flow from a venturi-based
  flow-meter, dynamic abdominal and thoracic circumference from rotary-encoder based
  tape measures, and aeration data from electrical impedance tomography (EIT). Data
  was collected from 80 adults, breathing with continuous positive airway pressure
  (CPAP) ventilation, under ethical consent from the University of Canterbury Human
  Research Ethics Committee (HREC 2023/04/LR-PS). In each subject&rsquo;s recording
  the positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was increased from 4 to 12 cmH2O in
  0.5 cmH2O increments, with data recorded for 30 seconds at each level. Time was
  built in for researchers to change PEEP settings, in which data continued to be
  collected. The recording also begins and ends with a 60 second period of breathing
  without CPAP. During the trial subjects breathed through a full-face mask and filter
  collected to the data collection device and, when PEEP was applied, CPAP circuitry.
  A camera-shutter based device was used to rapidly occlude the expiratory pathway
  to enable identification of passive lung mechanics. Subjects were instructed to
  breathe normally throughout the trial. Both raw and processed data is included in
  this publication to maximise its utility. Subject demographic data was self-reported
  using a questionnaire completed prior to each trial and is collated in a spreadsheet
  as part of this dataset. The demographic data collected was as follows: sex; height;
  weight; age; any history of asthma; smoking, or vaping; and resting chest width
  and depth. Ultimately, this dataset was collected to enable the development and
  validation of model-based respiratory function assessment methods. These methods
  aim to increase the capacity of automated testing, removing clinical burden of respiratory
  monitoring and improving patient-specific care. '
