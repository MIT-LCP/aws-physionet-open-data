Name: Kiel Cardio Database
Description: The Kiel Cardio Database, which includes magnetocardiography (MCG) measurements
  of seven healthy male volunteers, is presented in this publication. QuSpin QZFM
  Gen 1 sensors were used in a magnetically shielded chamber at the University of
  Kiel. Each subject underwent 25 one-minute measurements, resulting in magnetic field
  recordings at 200 different positions for each subject. The dataset is intended
  to facilitate MCG research by making this expensive method accessible to researchers
  without the necessary equipment. Future versions of the database will expand its
  utility for cardiac research and arrhythmogenic tissue localization by incorporating
  electrocardiography (ECG), magneto-tomographic imaging (MRI), and annotation data.
