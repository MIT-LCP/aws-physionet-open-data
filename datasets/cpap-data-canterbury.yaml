Name: CPAP Pressure and Flow Data from a Local Trial of 30 Adults at the University
  of Canterbury
Description: 'A pressure and flow dataset for CPAP (continuous positive airway pressure)
  breathing obtained from 30 subjects for model-based identification of patient-specific
  lung mechanics using a specially designed sensor system comprising an array of differential
  pressure sensors (Sensirion AG SDP816-125PA) and gauge pressure sensors (NXP MPVZ4006GW7U).
  Relevant medical information was collected using a questionnaire, including: sex;
  age; weight; height; smoking history; and history of asthma. Subjects were tasked
  with breathing at five different rates (including passive) from very slow to very
  fast breathing, matched to an online pacing sound and video, at two different levels
  of CPAP (4 and 7 cmH2O) for between 50 and 180 seconds depending on rate. Each data
  set for a breathing rate comprises ~17 breaths, including rest periods between breathing
  rates and CPAP levels. Data with significant observed sensor error was removed during
  processing. A better-fitted mask would be expected to reduce error in fully capturing
  expiration by reducing leaks around the masks seal with the face. The sensors measure
  inspiration and expiration using separate unidirectional differential flow sensors,
  which are combined in post-processing to for complete breathing data.'
