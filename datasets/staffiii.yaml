Name: STAFF III Database
Description: The STAFF III database was acquired during 1995&ndash;96 at Charleston
  Area Medical Center (WV, USA) where single prolonged balloon inflation had been
  introduced to achieve optimal results of percutaneous transluminal coronary angiography
  (PTCA) procedures, replacing the typical series of brief inflations. The lead investigator
  Dr. Stafford Warren designed the study protocol together with Dr. Galen Wagner at
  Duke University Medical Center (Durham, NC, USA); Dr. Michael Ringborn (Blekinge
  Hospital, Karlskrona, Sweden) was responsible for data acquisition. The database
  consists of ECG recordings from 104 patients, accounting for substantial inter-patient
  variability in reaction to prolonged balloon inflation as well as variability of
  heart rhythm and waveform morphology. Only patients receiving elective PTCA in one
  of the major coronary arteries were included. Patients suffering from ventricular
  tachycardia, undergoing an emergency procedure, or demonstrating signal loss during
  acquisition, were excluded.
