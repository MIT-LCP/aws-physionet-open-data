Name: Cardiorespiratory measurement from graded cycloergometer exercise testing
Description: The present database is an ensemble of cardiorespiratory measurements
  acquired during 18 cycloergometer maximal graded exercise tests performed in the
  &quot;Adaptation, Climat Tropical, Exercice et Sant&eacute;&quot; (ACTES) laboratory
  of the French West Indies University. Data correspond to heart R-wave to R-wave
  intervals, Oxygen consumption, and mechanical power output on a beat-to-beat basis
  recorded all along the graded exercise test sessions. Participants are 18 teenagers
  athletes (15.2&plusmn;2 years) from the Regional Physical and Sports Education Centre
  (CREPS) of French West Indies (Guadeloupe, France), belonging to a regional division
  of sprint kayak and triathlon or a national division of fencing. Clinical data of
  the participants (i.e. age, Weight, Height, Power at ventilatory threshold 1 and
  2, and sport discipline) are provided in a separate file.
