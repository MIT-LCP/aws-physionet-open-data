Name: 'Brain Hemorrhage Extended (BHX): Bounding box extrapolation from thick to thin
  slice CT images'
Description: "BHX is a public available dataset with bounding box annotations for\
  \ 5 types of acute hemorrhage as an extension of the qure.ai CQ500 dataset. This\
  \ dataset intends to provide data resources to help advance hemorrhage detection\
  \ towards machine learning localization tasks.\n\nKey Points:&nbsp;\n\n\n\t\n\t\
  BHX contains up to 39,668 bounding boxes in 23,409 images annotated for hemorrhage,\
  \ out of a total of ~170k images from qure.ai CQ500 dataset.&nbsp;\n\t\n\t\n\tThe\
  \ dataset was built through an efficient method to obtain automatic annotated images\
  \ (thin slices) from sparse initial labeling (thick slices).\n\t\n\t\n\tWe hope\
  \ this dataset can contribute to further develop and validate machine learning algorithms,\
  \ ultimately helping to diagnose intracranial hemorrhage.\n\t\n"
