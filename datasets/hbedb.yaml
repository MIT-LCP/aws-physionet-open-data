Name: Human Balance Evaluation Database
Description: 'The HBEDB contains force platform recordings from subjects undergoing
  stabilography tests. The subjects performed standing tasks under four different
  conditions: with their eyes opened or closed, while standing on a rigid or unstable
  surface. Each condition was tested three times, with the order of the conditions
  being randomized among subjects. A total of 1930 trials performed by 163 different
  subjects are given in this database.'
