Name: 'ScientISST MOVE: Annotated Wearable Multimodal Biosignals recorded during Everyday
  Life Activities in Naturalistic Environments'
Description: 'Existing datasets containing physiological data are mostly acquired
  at rest or in controlled scenarios. As a result, algorithms developed using such
  data may not perform as well as with biosignals acquired in dynamic and uncontrolled
  environments. ScientiSST MOVE is a multimodal dataset recording natural everyday
  activities, including lifting a chair, greeting, gesticulating, walking and running.
  Data was collected using three wearable devices, namely: a chestband, an armband,
  and the Empatica E4 wristband. This setup enabled recording of multi-channel Electrodermal
  Activity (EDA), Photoplethysmography (PPG) and Electrocardiography (ECG). Additionally,
  recordings were also made for bicep Electromyography (EMG), wrist temperature and
  chest and wrist actigraphy. A total of 17 healthy volunteers participated in the
  experimental data acquisition sessions, resulting in an average of 37 useful minutes
  of synchronised data from all sensors. ScientISST MOVE has been primarily designed
  to study the effect of daily activities on physiological data acquisition. Having
  been acquired with multiple wearable devices, some of which measuring the same modalities,
  it can also be useful in signal quality comparison studies.'
