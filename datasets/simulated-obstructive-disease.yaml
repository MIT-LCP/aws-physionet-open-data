Name: Simulated Obstructive Disease Respiratory Pressure and Flow
Description: 'The dataset presented is from 20 healthy adults at the University of
  Canterbury, where the tests were approved by its Human Research Ethics Committee
  (HREC) ethics. Data was collected using a modular device simulating the effects
  of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) in healthy people, and in particular,
  the gas trapping due to airway collapse in expiration. Pressure and flow data were
  recorded in this trial using a y-split venturi with the device attached to the exhalatory
  outlet by the mouth.&nbsp; Data was collected using continuous positive airway pressure
  (CPAP) ventilation at positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) settings of 4 and
  8 cmH20, and without the CPAP at zero end-expiratory pressure (ZEEP). The recording
  time for each test was 45 seconds with time in between each test to allow subjects
  to recover. Each subject filled out a de-identified demographic questionnaire to
  gather background information, including age, height, sex, and history of smoking,
  vaping, or asthma. The data collected is intended to be used as a preliminary validation
  method of respiratory computational models, where the device use avoids the need
  to test unhealthy people or use invasive methods. '
