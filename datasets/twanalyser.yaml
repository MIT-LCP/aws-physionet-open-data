Name: TWAnalyser - A T-wave Alternans Detector
Description: 'This software suite consists of Matlab implementations of the widely
  used Spectral Method (SM) and Modified Moving Average (MMA) for T-wave alternans
  (TWA) detection. It was initially developed for the PhysioNet/CinC Challenge 2008,
  in which these and a wide variety of other methods were evaluated and compared in
  blinded tests, using a data set that included ECGs with and without TWA as well
  as synthetic ECGs with calibrated amounts of artificial TWA. The implementation
  of SM presented here scored second in the open-source category and third overall
  with a score of 0.881. TWAanalyser&#39;s implementation of MMA received a score
  of 0.400. (A third method, which combined both algorithms, scored 0.834, not quite
  as well as SM alone. In this case, ECGs in which SM did not detect TWA were assigned
  a TWA estimate of 0, and all others were assigned the MMA algorithm&#39;s TWA estimate.)
  Most of the work to improve the score resulted from adjustments to filtering and
  alignment.


  TWAnalyser has been tested on both Windows XP (SP2) and Linux (Fedora Core 4-9)
  using Matlab R13 (6.5) and R2006b (7.3).'
