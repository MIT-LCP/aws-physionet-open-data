Name: Smart Health for Assessing the Risk of Events via ECG Database
Description: The SHAREE database was developed in order to investigate the possibility
  to identify hypertensive subjects at higher risk to develop vascular events based
  on Heart Rate Variability analysis. The research material in the SHAREE database
  included nominal 24-h electrocardiographic (ECG) Holter recordings of 139 hypertensive
  patients recruited at the Centre of Hypertension of the University Hospital of Naples
