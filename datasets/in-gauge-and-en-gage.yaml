Name: 'In-Gauge and En-Gage: Understanding Occupants'' Behaviour, Engagement, Emotion,
  and Comfort Indoors with Heterogeneous Sensors and Wearables'
Description: 'We conducted a field study at a K-12 private school in the suburbs of
  Melbourne, Australia. The datasets contained two elements: (1) In-Gauge dataset:
  we conducted a 5-month longitudinal field study using two outdoor weather stations,
  as well as indoor weather stations in 17 classrooms and temperature sensors on the
  vents of occupant-controlled room air-conditioners; these were collated into individual
  datasets for each classroom at a 5-minute logging frequency, including additional
  data on occupant presence. (2) En-Gage dataset: we tracked 23 students and 6 teachers
  in a 4-week cross-sectional study En-Gage, using wearable sensors to log physiological
  data (electrodermal activity, heart rate, blood column pulse, skin temperature,
  3-axis acceleration), as well as daily surveys to query the occupants&#39; thermal
  comfort, learning engagement, emotions and seating behaviours. Overall, the combined
  dataset could be used to analyse the relationships between indoor/outdoor climates
  and students&#39; behaviours/mental states on campus, which provide opportunities
  for the future design of intelligent feedback systems to benefit both students and
  staff.'
