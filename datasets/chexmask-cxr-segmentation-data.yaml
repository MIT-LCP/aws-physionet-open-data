Name: 'CheXmask Database: a large-scale dataset of anatomical segmentation masks for
  chest x-ray images'
Description: 'The CheXmask Database presents a comprehensive, uniformly annotated
  collection of chest radiographs, constructed from five public databases: ChestX-ray8,
  Chexpert, MIMIC-CXR-JPG, Padchest and VinDr-CXR. The database aggregates 657,566
  anatomical segmentation masks derived from images which have been processed using
  the HybridGNet model to ensure consistent, high-quality segmentation. To confirm
  the quality of the segmentations, we include in this database individual Reverse
  Classification Accuracy (RCA) scores for each of the segmentation masks. This dataset
  is intended to catalyze further innovation and refinement in the field of semantic
  chest X-ray analysis, offering a significant resource for researchers in the medical
  imaging domain.'
