Name: ECGSYN - A realistic ECG waveform generator
Description: ECGSYN generates a synthesized ECG signal with user-settable mean heart
  rate, number of beats, sampling frequency, waveform morphology (P, Q, R, S, and
  T timing, amplitude,and duration), standard deviation of the RR interval, and LF/HF
  ratio (a measure of the relative contributions of the low and high frequency components
  of the RR time series to total heart rate variability).
