Name: Model for Simulating ECG and PPG Signals with Arrhythmia Episodes
Description: 'The simulation of electrocardiographic (ECG) and photoplethysmographic
  (PPG) signals with cardiac arrhythmias is important when developing and testing
  arrhythmia detectors. This&nbsp;software is capable of simulating sinus rhythm,
  episodes of atrial fibrillation and atrial premature beats in ECGs and PPGs as well
  as extreme bradycardia and ventricular tachycardia in PPGs. Different types of noise
  and artifacts can be added to simulated signals to improve realism and mimic the
  signals acquired in free-living conditions. Two versions are provided: a binary
  version for Windows 10 and Matlab source code.'
