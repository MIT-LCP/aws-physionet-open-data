Name: ECG Fragment Database for the Exploration of Dangerous Arrhythmia
Description: 'The database contains a set of 2 second fragments of ECG signals with
  rhythm disturbances, which are grouped into separate classes according to the degree
  of threat to the patient&#39;s life. It is intended for practical use to develop
  and test the efficiency of algorithms for detecting dangerous arrhythmias for continuous
  monitoring systems.


  The &ldquo;MIT-BIH Malignant Ventricular Ectopy Database&rdquo; (MVED) was selected
  as the primary source of ECG records. This database contains heart rhythm disturbances
  necessary for research and is widely used for testing and comparative analysis of
  various algorithms for detecting arrhythmia threats. The signal is a modified limb
  lead II (MLII).'
