Name: Visceral adipose tissue measurements during pregnancy
Description: 'This database is from a cohort study of pregnant women up to 20 weeks
  of pregnancy and followed until delivery. Measurement of maternal visceral adipose
  tissue (VAT) was performed during routine obstetric ultrasound. At this time, the
  biometric evaluation was also performed, and information obtained from prenatal
  care. Gestational outcomes, including gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), were
  obtained through evaluating the patients&#39; medical records at the hospitals where
  they took place. The data was collected as part of a study that sought to evaluate
  if maternal VAT could predict GDM at time of delivery. Variables included in this
  dataset are maternal age, previous DM, blood pressure (in the same day of VAT measurement),
  VAT (in the periumbilical region), gestational age at time of inclusion, number
  of pregnancies, level of first fasting glucose, pre-gestational body mass index
  (BMI). Also, the pregnancy outcomes: gestational age at birth, type of delivery
  (vaginal or caesarean section), child birth weight and the diagnosis of GDM.'
