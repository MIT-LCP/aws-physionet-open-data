Name: Waveform Database Software Package (WFDB) for Python
Description: Physiological waveforms - such as electrocardiograms (ECG), electroencephalograms
  (EEG), electromyograms (EMG) - are generated during the course of routine care.
  These signals contain information that can be used to understand underlying conditions
  of health. Effective processing and analysis of physiological data requires specialized
  software. The waveform-database (WFDB) package for Python is a library of tools
  for reading, writing, and processing physiological signals and annotations, written
  in the Python programming language. Core components of the Python package are loosely
  based on the specifications of the original C-language WFDB software. We aim to
  implement as many of the core WFDB features as possible, with user-friendly APIs.
  Additional features are added over time.
