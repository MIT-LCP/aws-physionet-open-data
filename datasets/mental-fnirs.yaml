Name: Mental workload during n-back task captured by TransCranial Doppler (TCD) sonography
  and functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) monitoring
Description: 'The authors used this dataset to assess the neurovascular coupling responses
  evoked by a cognitive paradigm with the aid of TransCranial Doppler (TCD) sonography
  and functional Near-InfraRed Spectroscopy (fNIRS). Fourteen healthy young individuals
  were recruited for this study conducted in 2018 at the University of Oklahoma, Translational
  Geroscience Laboratory (age: 31&plusmn;5.94 years, BMI: 24.9&plusmn;2.95). The following
  physiological signals were measured non-invasively during the examination: relative
  concentration of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin (HbO and HbR, respectively), and cerebral
  Blood Flow Velocity (BFV) in the middle cerebral arteries for the entire duration
  of the testing (~11 minutes). In this study, fNIRS signals from the frontal cortex
  were acquired by a NIRScout platform (NIRx Medical Technologies LLC, NY, USA) at
  a sampling frequency of 3.9 Hz, HbO and HbR time series signals can be obtained
  by applying the differential modified Beer Lambert Law on the preprocessed records
  of near-infrared intensities. BFV was recorded using TCD sonography (Digi-Lite,
  Rimed, Raanana, Israel) by placing 2 Mhz ultrasound probes over the left and right
  temporal acoustic windows. The paradigm used for cognitive testing was an n-back
  task where the participant was administered a series of alphabetical letters on
  the computer screen and had to provide a response whenever a stimulus is presented
  that is the same as the one presented n trials previously. The examination protocol
  consisted of the following 134 second sessions: 0-back, 1-back, 0-back, and 2-back.
  This dataset was collected for the following study: &quot;Increased Cognitive Workload
  Evokes Greater Neurovascular Coupling Responses in Healthy Young Adults&quot;.'
