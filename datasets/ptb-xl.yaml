Name: PTB-XL, a large publicly available electrocardiography dataset
Description: 'Electrocardiography (ECG) is a key diagnostic tool to assess the cardiac
  condition of a patient. Automatic ECG interpretation algorithms as diagnosis support
  systems promise large reliefs for the medical personnel - only on the basis of the
  number of ECGs that are routinely taken. However, the development of such algorithms
  requires large training datasets and clear benchmark procedures. In our opinion,
  both aspects are not covered satisfactorily by existing freely accessible ECG datasets.


  The PTB-XL ECG dataset is a large dataset of 21799 clinical 12-lead ECGs from 18869
  patients of 10 second length. The raw waveform data was annotated by up to two cardiologists,
  who assigned potentially multiple ECG statements to each record. The in total 71
  different ECG statements conform to the SCP-ECG standard and cover diagnostic, form,
  and rhythm statements. To ensure comparability of machine learning algorithms trained
  on the dataset, we provide recommended splits into training and test sets. In combination
  with the extensive annotation, this turns the dataset into a rich resource for the
  training and the evaluation of automatic ECG interpretation algorithms. The dataset
  is complemented by extensive metadata on demographics, infarction characteristics,
  likelihoods for diagnostic ECG statements as well as annotated signal properties.'
