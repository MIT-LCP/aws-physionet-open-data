Name: Tappy Keystroke Data
Description: "This is the keystroke dataset for the study titled &#39;High-accuracy\
  \ detection of early Parkinson&#39;s Disease using multiple characteristics of finger\
  \ movement while typing&#39;. This research report is currently under review for\
  \ publication by PLOS ONE.\r\n\r\nThe dataset contains keystroke logs collected\
  \ from over 200 subjects, with and without Parkinson&#39;s Disease (PD), as they\
  \ typed normally on their own computer (without any supervision) over a period of\
  \ weeks or months (having initially installed a custom keystroke recording app,\
  \ Tappy). This dataset has been collected and analyzed in order to indicate that\
  \ the routine interaction with computer keyboards can be used to detect changes\
  \ in the characteristics of finger movement in the early stages of PD."
