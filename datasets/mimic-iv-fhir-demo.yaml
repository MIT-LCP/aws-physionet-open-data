Name: MIMIC-IV Clinical Database Demo on FHIR
Description: Interoperability of healthcare data has become increasingly important
  given the increase in deployment of data driven algorithms in clinical settings.
  The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard has emerged as a
  promising mechanism to share healthcare data across vendors in real-time and batch
  settings. Real-world datasets available in FHIR would accelerate research and development
  of data-driven algorithms. Existing datasets in FHIR are primarily synthetic, and
  cover a limited number of resources. To address this gap, we have reformatted the
  Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV Clinical Database Demo into
  FHIR. The MIMIC clinical databases have received wide adoption and the constituent
  data are understood by the community. As much as possible, we adhered to the base
  resources with minimal extensions. Alongside the dataset, we publish openly available
  code allowing researchers to quickly build upon our work. Translating MIMIC-IV into
  FHIR provides a benchmark dataset for institutions to experiment with FHIR based
  tools, and we hope this resource supports adoption and use of FHIR.&nbsp;
