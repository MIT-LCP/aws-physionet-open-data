Name: MIMIC Database
Description: The MIMIC Database includes data recorded from over 90 ICU patients.
  The data in each case include signals and periodic measurements obtained from a
  bedside monitor as well as clinical data obtained from the patient&#39;s medical
  record. The recordings vary in length; almost all of them are at least 20 hours,
  and many are 40 hours or more. In all, the database contains nearly 200 patient-days
  of real-time signals and accompanying data.
