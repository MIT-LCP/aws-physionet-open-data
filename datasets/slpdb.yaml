Description: The MIT-BIH Polysomnographic Database is a collection of recordings of
  multiple physiologic signals during sleep. Subjects were monitored in Boston&#39;s
  Beth Israel Hospital Sleep Laboratory for evaluation of chronic obstructive sleep
  apnea syndrome, and to test the effects of constant positive airway pressure (CPAP),
  a standard therapeutic intervention that usually prevents or substantially reduces
  airway obstruction in these subjects.
