Name: Behavioral and autonomic dynamics during propofol-induced unconsciousness
Description: 'During general anesthesia, both behavioral and autonomic changes are
  caused by the administration of anesthetics such as propofol. Propofol produces
  unconsciousness by creating highly structured oscillations in brain circuits. The
  anesthetic also has autonomic effects due to its actions as a vasodilator and myocardial
  depressant. Understanding how autonomic dynamics change in relation to propofol-induced
  unconsciousness is an important scientific and clinical question since anesthesiologists
  often infer changes in level of unconsciousness from changes in autonomic dynamics.


  Therefore, we present a dataset combining physiology-based indices for heart rate
  variability and electrodermal activity with a robust statistical tool to compare
  behavioral and multimodal autonomic changes before, during, and after propofol-induced
  unconsciousness. This dataset was recorded from nine healthy volunteers during computer-controlled
  administration of propofol.&nbsp;'
