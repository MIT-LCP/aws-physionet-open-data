Name: Examples of Electromyograms
Description: "An electromyogram (EMG) is a common clinical test used to assess function\
  \ of muscles and the nerves that control them. EMG studies are used to help in the\
  \ diagnosis and management of disorders such as the muscular dystrophies and neuropathies.\
  \ Nerve conduction studies that measure how well and how fast the nerves conduct\
  \ impulses are often performed in conjunction with EMG studies.\r\n\r\nExamples\
  \ of EMG studies (courtesy of Seward Rutkove, MD, Department of Neurology, Beth\
  \ Israel Deaconess Medical Center/Harvard Medical School) are given here."
