Name: Long Term ST Database
Description: The Long-Term ST Database contains 86 lengthy ECG recordings of 80 human
  subjects, chosen to exhibit a variety of events of ST segment changes, including
  ischemic ST episodes, axis-related non-ischemic ST episodes, episodes of slow ST
  level drift, and episodes containing mixtures of these phenomena. The database was
  created to support development and evaluation of algorithms capable of accurate
  differentiation of ischemic and non-ischemic ST events, as well as basic research
  into mechanisms and dynamics of myocardial ischemia.
