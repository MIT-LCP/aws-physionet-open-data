Name: T-Wave Alternans Challenge Database
Description: This database has been assembled for the PhysioNet/Computers in Cardiology
  Challenge 2008. It contains 100 multichannel ECG records sampled at 500 Hz with
  16 bit resolution over a &plusmn; 32 mV range. The subjects include patients with
  myocardial infarctions, transient ischemia, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and other
  risk factors for sudden cardiac death, as well as healthy controls and synthetic
  cases with calibrated amounts of T-wave alternans.
