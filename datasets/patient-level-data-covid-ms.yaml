Name: Patient-level dataset to study the effect of COVID-19 in people with Multiple
  Sclerosis
Description: Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory autoimmune disease of the
  central nervous system, causing increased vulnerability to infections and disability
  among young adults. Ever since the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak,
  caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 infections, there have
  been concerns among people with MS (PwMS) about the potential interactions between
  various disease-modifying therapies and COVID-19. The COVID-19 in MS Global Data
  Sharing Initiative (GDSI) was initiated in 2020 to address these concerns. This
  paper focuses on the anonymisation and open-sourcing of a GDSI sub-dataset, comprising
  data entered by people with MS and clinicians using a fast data entry tool. The
  dataset includes demographics, comorbidities, hospital stay, and COVID-19 symptoms
  of PwMS. The dataset can be used to perform different statistical analyses to improve
  our understanding of COVID-19 in MS. Furthermore, this dataset can also be used
  within the context of educational activities to educate different stakeholders on
  the complex data science topics that were used within the GDSI.
