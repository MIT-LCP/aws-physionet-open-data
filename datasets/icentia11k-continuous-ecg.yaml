Name: Icentia11k Single Lead Continuous Raw Electrocardiogram Dataset
Description: This is a dataset of continuous raw electrocardiogram (ECG) signals containing
  11 thousand patients and 2 billion labelled beats. The signals were recorded with
  a 16-bit resolution at 250Hz with a fixed chest mounted single lead probe for up
  to 2 weeks. The average age of the patient is 62.2&plusmn;17.4 years. 20 technologists
  annotated each beat&#39;s type (Normal, Premature Atrial Contraction, Premature
  Ventricular contraction) and rhythm (Normal Sinusal Rhythm, Atrial Fibrillation,
  Atrial Flutter).
