Name: 'Q-Pain: A Question Answering Dataset to Measure Social Bias in Pain Management'
Description: 'We introduce Q-Pain, a dataset for assessing bias in medical QA in the
  context of pain management. We developed 55 medical question-answer pairs across
  five different types of pain management: each question includes a detailed patient-specific
  medical scenario (&quot;vignette&quot;) designed to enable the substitution of multiple
  different racial and gender &quot;profiles&quot; and to evaluate whether bias is
  present when answering whether or not to prescribe medication.


  Along with the dataset, we propose a new framework, including a sample experimental
  design, to measure the potential bias present during medical decision-making for
  patients with particular demographic profiles. We demonstrate its use in assessing
  two reference QA systems, GPT-2 and GPT-3, selected for their documented ability
  to answer questions given only a few examples. We hope that our dataset and framework
  will be used to assess bias across a wide variety of pain management QA systems.'
