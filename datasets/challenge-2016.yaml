Name: 'Classification of Heart Sound Recordings: The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology
  Challenge 2016'
Description: The 2016 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge aims to encourage the development of
  algorithms to classify heart sound recordings collected from a variety of clinical
  or nonclinical (such as in-home visits) environments. The aim is to identify, from
  a single short recording (10-60s) from a single precordial location, whether the
  subject of the recording should be referred on for an expert diagnosis.
