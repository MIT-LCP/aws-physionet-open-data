Name: Effect of 24-hour sleep deprivation on cerebral hemodynamics and cognitive performance
Description: 'Sleep deprivation (SD) is associated&nbsp;with decreased cognitive performance,
  but&nbsp;the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. To assess the impact of
  SD on cerebral hemodynamics&nbsp;in the frontal lobe, functional near-infrared spectroscopy
  (fNIRS) measurements were carried out on young subjects.&nbsp;Ten young healthy
  adults (males, age of 27.6&plusmn;3.7 years, one left-handed participant) were recruited
  for this study conducted in&nbsp;2018 at University of Oklahoma, Translational Geroscience
  Laboratory. The examination protocol began with assessment of&nbsp;cognitive performance
  with the aid of Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). The
  following tests were used: motor screening task, rapid visual processing, reaction
  time, spatial working memory, paired associated&nbsp;learning, and delayed matching
  to visual sample.&nbsp;Subsequently fNIRS measurements were taken from&nbsp;participants
  while carrying out a&nbsp;finger-tapping exercise. Each subject was presented with
  an auditory command to perform a finger-tapping task over three sets of 10 seconds
  using the left index finger and three sets of 10 seconds using the right index finger,
  with 10 seconds inter-stimulus periods between each task.&nbsp;Functional NIRS recordings
  were acquired using a NIRScout platform (NIRx Medical Technologies LLC, NY, USA).&nbsp;Relative
  oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin time series can be obtained from measured intensities by
  applying&nbsp;differential modified Beer Lamber Law.&nbsp;All measurements&nbsp;were
  performed before and after 24 hours of SD. The&nbsp;dataset forms the basis for
  two studies that explore: (1)&nbsp;the relationship between sleep deprivation, cognitive
  performance, and&nbsp;neurovascular coupling response&nbsp;in young healthy adults;
  and (2)&nbsp;sleep deprivation and functional connectivity of the frontal cortex.'
