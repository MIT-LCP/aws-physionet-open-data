Name: Gait in Neurodegenerative Disease Database
Description: Neuro-degenerative disease often affects gait and mobility. To understand
  better the pathophysiology of these diseases and to improve our ability to measure
  responses to therapeutic interventions, it may be helpful to quantify gait dynamics
  accurately. The records in this database are from patients with Parkinson&#39;s
  disease (n = 15), Huntington&#39;s disease (n = 20), or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
  (n = 13). Records from 16 healthy control subjects are also included here.
