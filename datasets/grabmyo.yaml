Name: Gesture Recognition and Biometrics ElectroMyogram (GRABMyo)
Description: 'We present the Gesture Recognition and Biometrics ElectroMyogram (GRABMyo)
  dataset, an open-access dataset of electromyogram (EMG) recordings collected from
  the wrist and forearm muscles while performing hand gestures. Data were collected
  from 43 healthy participants (age range: 24-35 years) on three different days while
  performing 16 hand and finger gestures in identical experimental sessions on each
  day. The GRABMyo dataset can be used for research on: 1) EMG-based biometrics for
  personal identification and verification, and 2) EMG-based gesture recognition for
  neurorehabilitation and home applications. The large sample size will provide sufficient
  power for establishing results, specifically for applications such as biometrics.
  Further, it will be useful for subject-independent applications such as generalized
  classification models for gesture recognition. The multiday recordings will provide
  results that will be consistent over a longer duration, crucial for the reliability
  of EMG-based wearable devices.'
