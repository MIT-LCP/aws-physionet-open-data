Name: BIG IDEAs Lab Glycemic Variability and Wearable Device Data
Description: This study aimed to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of wearable
  devices in detecting early physiological changes prior to the development of prediabetes
  [1-3]. The study generated digital biomarkers for remote, mHealth-based prediabetes
  and hyperglycemia risk to classify which individuals should undergo further clinical
  testing. The primary inclusion criteria were subjects aged 35-65 years, inclusive,
  including only post-menopausal females, with a point of care A1C measurement between
  5.2-6.4%, inclusive. Blood was collected during the study for measurement of glucose,
  hemoglobin A1C, lipoproteins, and triglycerides. Participants wore a Dexcom 6 continuous
  glucose monitor (CGM) and an Empatica E4 wristband for 10 days while receiving a
  standardized breakfast meal every other day. At the end of the 10 days, the participant
  returned to the clinic for an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Research data
  collected includes physiological measurements from wearable devices such as heart
  rate, accelerometry, and electrodermal conductance.
