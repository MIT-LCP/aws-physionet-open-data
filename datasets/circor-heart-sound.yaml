Name: The CirCor DigiScope Phonocardiogram Dataset
Description: A total number of 5272 heart sound recordings were collected from the
  main four auscultation locations of 1568 subjects, aged between 0 and 21 years (mean
  &plusmn; STD = 6.1 &plusmn; 4.3 years), with a duration between 4.8 to 80.4 seconds
  (mean &plusmn; STD = 22.9 &plusmn; 7.4 s), totaling more than 33.5 hours of recording.
  Each cardiac murmur in the dataset has been annotated in detail by a human annotator,
  in terms of timing, shape, pitch, grading, quality and location. Moreover, segmentation
  annotations regarding the location of fundamental heart sounds (S1 and S2) in the
  recordings have been obtained using a semi-supervised scheme. The segmentation annotations
  were performed by voting between three state-of-the-art machine-based algorithms.
  An expert annotator later studied the consensus and mismatches between the algorithms
  beat-by-beat and performed a manual annotation whenever the algorithms had disagreed
  or were not acceptable for the expert. To date, the dataset is the largest publicly
  available pediatric heart sound dataset, supporting deeper research on the topic
  of auscultation-based health recommendation systems. The dataset is being used in
  the George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2022 on Heart Murmur Detection from Phonocardiogram
  Recordings.
