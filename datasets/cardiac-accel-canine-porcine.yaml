Name: Epicardially attached cardiac accelerometer data from canines and porcines
Description: The database contains acceleration signals from accelerometers attached
  directly on the epicardium in canines and porcines during various interventions
  that altered cardiac function and myocardial motion. The tri-axial accelerometer
  was attached in the anterior, apical region of the left ventricle (LV). The database
  contains a total of 289 recordings from 19 canines and 27 porcines with an average
  duration of 15 seconds, ranging from 5 to 30 seconds. Acceleration data was recorded
  simultaneously with ECG and LV pressure (LVP).
