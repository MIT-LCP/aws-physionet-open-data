Name: Samples of MR Images
Description: These magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) images show coronal slices
  acquired from consecutive anteroposterior positions within the torso. The study
  was performed on a 1.5T General Electric (GE) Signa imaging system with gadolinium-contrast-enhancement
  for visualization of the cardiopulmonary vasculature. The pulse sequence used was
  a 3D time-of-flight fast spoiled gradient recalled acquisition in steady state (FSPGR,
  TR=6.3, TE=1.4, NEX=1, FOV = 40cm, slice thickness = 1.2mm).
