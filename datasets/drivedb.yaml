Name: Stress Recognition in Automobile Drivers
Description: This database, contributed to PhysioNet by its creator, Jennifer Healey,
  contains a collection of multiparameter recordings from healthy volunteers, taken
  while they were driving on a prescribed route including city streets and highways
  in and around Boston, Massachusetts. The objective of the study for which these
  data were collected was to investigate the feasibility of automated recognition
  of stress on the basis of the recorded signals, which include ECG, EMG (right trapezius),
  GSR (galvanic skin resistance) measured on the hand and foot, and respiration.
