Name: 'Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation Events Detection from Dynamic ECG Recordings:
  The 4th China Physiological Signal Challenge 2021'
Description: "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the most frequent arrhythmia, but paroxysmal\
  \ atrial fibrillation (PAF) often remains unrecognized. Early detection of PAF&nbsp;is\
  \ of great value for AF surgery options, drug intervention and diagnosis and treatment\
  \ of various clinical complications.&nbsp;Although accurate detection of paroxysmal\
  \ AF is very important, there is currently no algorithm that can efficiently measure\
  \ the onset&nbsp;and end&nbsp;of AF episode in dynamic or wearable ECGs. Previous\
  \ AF detection algorithms usually focus on the classification of AF rhythm instead\
  \ of locating the onsets and ends of AF episodes. Thus, the clinical significance\
  \ for the personalized treatment and management of AF patients is limited. The identification\
  \ of AF rhythm is also influenced by other abnormal rhythms in clinical applications.\
  \ \n\nThe 4th China Physiological Signal Challenge 2021 (CPSC 2021) aims to encourage\
  \ the development of algorithms for searching the AF episodes in&nbsp;dynamic ECG\
  \ records. A new dynamic ECG database was constructed to encourage the development\
  \ of more efficient and robust algorithms for PAF&nbsp;detection. We also develop\
  \ a new scoring metric to evaluate detection methods for PAF events."
