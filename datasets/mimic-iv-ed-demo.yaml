Name: MIMIC-IV-ED Demo
Description: MIMIC-IV-ED is a publicly accessible database of over 400,000 emergency
  department (ED) admissions to the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2011
  and 2019. Access to MIMIC-IV-ED requires registration on PhysioNet, identity verification,
  completion of human participant training, and signing of a data use agreement.&nbsp;Here,
  we have provided an openly available demo of MIMIC-IV-ED containing&nbsp;a subset
  of&nbsp;100 patients. Being a derivative dataset, the MIMIC-IV-ED demo is deidentified
  according to the same standard as MIMIC-IV-ED. The demo is intended to support workshops,
  educational material, exploration of MIMIC-IV-ED, and other aims enabled by an openly
  available dataset.
