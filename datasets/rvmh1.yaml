Name: Response to Valsalva Maneuver in Humans
Description: Functional metrics of autonomic control of heart rate, including baroreflex
  sensitivity, have been shown to be strongly associated with cardiovascular risk.
  A decrease in baroreflex sensitivity with aging is hypothesized to represent a contributing
  causal factor in the etiology of primary hypertension. To assess baroreflex function
  in human subjects, two complementary methods to simulate the response in heart rate
  elicited by the Valsalva maneuver were developed and applied to data obtained from
  a cohort of healthy normal volunteers.
