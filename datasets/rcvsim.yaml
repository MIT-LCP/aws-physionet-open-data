Name: A Cardiovascular Simulator for Research
Description: We introduce here the Research CardioVascular SIMulator (RCVSIM) software
  in order to complement research with the experimental data sets provided by PhysioBank.
  The human cardiovascular model upon which RCVSIM is based includes three major components.
  The first component is a lumped parameter model of the pulsatile heart and circulation.
  The second component is a short-term regulatory system model which includes an arterial
  baroreflex system, a cardiopulmonary baroreflex system, and a direct neural coupling
  mechanism between respiration and heart rate.
