Name: Apnea-ECG Database
Description: The data consist of 70 records, divided into a learning set of 35 records
  (a01 through a20, b01 through b05, and c01 through c10), and a test set of 35 records
  (x01 through x35), all of which may be downloaded from this page. Recordings vary
  in length from slightly less than 7 hours to nearly 10 hours each. Each recording
  includes a continuous digitized ECG signal, a set of apnea annotations (derived
  by human experts on the basis of simultaneously recorded respiration and related
  signals), and a set of machine-generated QRS annotations (in which all beats regardless
  of type have been labeled normal). In addition, eight recordings (a01 through a04,
  b01, and c01 through c03) are accompanied by four additional signals (Resp C and
  Resp A, chest and abdominal respiratory effort signals obtained using inductance
  plethysmography; Resp N, oronasal airflow measured using nasal thermistors; and
  SpO2, oxygen saturation).
