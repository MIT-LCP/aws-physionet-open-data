Name: MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database
Description: The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database contains 48 half-hour excerpts of two-channel
  ambulatory ECG recordings, obtained from 47 subjects studied by the BIH Arrhythmia
  Laboratory between 1975 and 1979. Twenty-three recordings were chosen at random
  from a set of 4000 24-hour ambulatory ECG recordings collected from a mixed population
  of inpatients (about 60%) and outpatients (about 40%) at Boston&#39;s Beth Israel
  Hospital; the remaining 25 recordings were selected from the same set to include
  less common but clinically significant arrhythmias that would not be well-represented
  in a small random sample.
