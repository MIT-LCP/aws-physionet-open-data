Name: ECG-Derived Respiration
Description: The ECG-Derived Respiration (EDR) technique is an approach to obtain
  a respiration signal from an ECG.. It is based on the observation that the positions
  of ECG electrodes on the chest surface move relative to the heart, and transthoracic
  impedance varies, as the lungs fill and empty. Thus the lead axes vary at different
  points in the respiratory cycle, and any sufficiently precise measurement of the
  mean cardiac electrical axis shows variations that are correlated with respiration.
  This method is particularly effective if two or more ECG signals are available,
  but a single lead is sufficient. The EDR can be obtained even in the context of
  congestive heart failure, in which RSA may be absent.
