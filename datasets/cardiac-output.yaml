Name: Cardiac Output Estimation from Arterial Blood Pressure Waveforms
Description: This project contains the code used for a study that rigorously compares
  11 estimates against thermodilution cardiac output (TCO) using 120 subjects from
  the MIMIC II database (all subjects for whom multiple TCO measurements were recorded
  at the time of the study).
