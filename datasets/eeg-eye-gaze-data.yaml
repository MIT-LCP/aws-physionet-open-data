Name: Electroencephalogram and eye-gaze datasets for robot-assisted surgery performance
  evaluation
Description: 'Surgical training and patient safety depend on objective and accurate
  performance evaluation. Robot-assisted surgery (RAS) is newer and its training less
  well defined, but resources are not easily accessed to support data collection from
  participants with various RAS skill levels. This work describes and makes available
  for public use electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye-gaze data collected from 25 participants
  performing RAS simulator tasks with varying levels of RAS experience.Twenty-seven
  tasks from six modules of the da Vinci&reg;;Skills Simulator &trade;, which are
  standard elements of most RAS surgical skills training curricula, were taken into
  consideration. The dataset contains performance scores (scale: 0 to 100) generated
  by the simulator after each exercise was completed. Each task was completed by the
  participants at least twice, and if they weren&#39;t able to complete it with a
  score of 70 (out of 100) on at least one try, they tried again until they did. The
  National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) and Roswell
  Park Comprehensive Cancer Center (RPCCC) supported the collection of data for use
  in RAS training, which is why the dataset has been named the NIBIB-RPCCC-RAS performance
  evaluation dataset. The dataset contains 1636 EEG recordings (in the &quot;*.edf&quot;
  format), 1559 eye-gaze recordings (in the &quot;*.csv&quot; format), performance
  scores, and participant demographic data, such as age, gender, and dominant hand.
  To our knowledge, this is the first shared dataset that contains EEG and eye-gaze
  data from participants with a variety of RAS experiences who performed all tasks
  included in the da Vinci simulator modules.'
