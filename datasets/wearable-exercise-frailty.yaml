Name: Wearable-based signals during physical exercises from patients with frailty
  after open-heart surgery
Description: This data collection contains a single-lead electrocardiogram and triaxial
  acceleration signals of 80 elderly frailty patients, who entered a cardiac rehabilitation
  program after open-heart surgery. The signals were collected using a chest-based
  heart rate monitor worn by the patients performing a series of exercise tests for
  health status assessment. The tests include veloergometry, 6-minute walk test, stair
  climbing test, timed up and go test, and gait analysis on a treadmill. The signals
  are supplemented with the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients
  including the Edmonton frail scale score and quantitative results of the exercise
  tests. This data collection could be particularly useful in developing wearable
  technology-based methods for (1) assessment of gait and balance in frailty patients
  and (2) monitoring of heart response to daily physical stressors.
