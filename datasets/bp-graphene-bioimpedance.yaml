Name: Continuous Cuffless Monitoring of Arterial Blood Pressure via Graphene Bioimpedance
  Tattoos
Description: '

  Continuous monitoring of arterial blood pressure (BP) in non-clinical (ambulatory)
  settings is essential for a proper understanding of numerous health conditions.
  While conventional ambulatory BP devices exist, they are uncomfortable, bulky, and
  intrusive. In this work, we introduce a dataset of BP measurement using atomically-thin
  graphene electronic tattoos (GETs) and bioimpedance (Bio-Z) as measurement modality.
  The Bio-Z is measured from radial and ulnar arteries on the wrist. Afterward, a
  machine learning regression model is employed to relate the recorded bioimpedance
  to BP, yielding an effective beat-to-beat BP monitoring platform. In this database,
  we are sharing the raw time data for the 4-channel GET Bioimpedance signals with
  BP and&nbsp;PPG signals. The GETs are used to monitor arterial blood pressure from
  N=7 individuals for 300+ minutes each. A medical-grade BP monitoring device, Finapres
  NOVA, was used to measure the subject&#39;s control BP during the experiments. On
  average, each participant underwent 4&plusmn;1 hours of continuous BP monitoring.
  Altogether, we performed on average ~2500&plusmn;600 BP measurements per participant,
  which resulted in a total of 18667 datapoints.
