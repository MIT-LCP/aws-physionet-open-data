Name: MIMIC-IV-ECG Demo - Diagnostic Electrocardiogram Matched Subset Demo
Description: The MIMIC-IV-ECG Demo module contains 659 diagnostic electrocardiograms
  across 92 unique patients. These 92 patients overlap with the patients from the
  MIMIC-IV Clinical Demo and are also part of the MIMIC-IV Clinical Database. These
  diagnostic ECGs use 12 leads and are 10 seconds in length. They are sampled at 500
  Hz. This open access demo allows researchers to assess whether the MIMIC-IV-ECG
  module is appropriate for their research and facilitates demonstration of these&nbsp;diagnostic
  ECGs.
