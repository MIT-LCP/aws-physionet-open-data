Name: Generalized Multiscale Entropy Analysis
Description: The method of generalized multiscale entropy (GMSE) analysis is useful
  for investigating complexity in physiologic signals and other series that have correlations
  at multiple (time) scales. It represents a generalization of the original method
  of multiscale entropy analysis.
