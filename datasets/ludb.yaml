Name: Lobachevsky University Electrocardiography Database
Description: Lobachevsky University Electrocardiography Database (LUDB) is an ECG
  signal database&nbsp;with marked boundaries and peaks of P, T waves and QRS&nbsp;complexes.&nbsp;The
  database consists of 200 10-second 12-lead ECG signal records representing different
  morphologies of the ECG signal. The ECGs were collected from healthy volunteers
  and patients of the Nizhny Novgorod City Hospital No 5 in 2017&ndash;2018. The patients
  had various cardiovascular diseases while&nbsp;some of them had pacemakers. The
  boundaries of P, T waves and QRS complexes were manually annotated by cardiologists
  for all 200 records. Also, each record is annotated with the corresponding diagnosis.
  The database can be used for educational purposes&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;for training
  and testing&nbsp;algorithms for ECG delineation, i.e. for automatic&nbsp;detection
  of boundaries and peaks of P, T waves and QRS complexes.
