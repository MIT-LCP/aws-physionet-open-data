Name: Safety and Preliminary Efficacy of Intranasal Insulin for Cognitive Impairment
  in Parkinson Disease and Multiple System Atrophy
Description: This dataset was collected as part of a study that&nbsp;aimed to determine
  the effects of intranasal insulin (INI) on cognition and motor performance in PD.
  The study&nbsp;was a proof of concept, randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled
  trial evaluating the effects of 40 international units (IU) of insulin or saline
  once daily for four weeks on cognitive and functional performance. Of 16 subjects
  enrolled, eight in the INI group and six in the placebo group completed verbal fluency
  (FAS), Unified Parkinson Disease Scale (UPDRS), and modified Hoehn and Yahr scale
  (HY, PD severity) at baseline and post-treatment and were included in the analyses.
