Name: Pulse Amplitudes from electrodermal activity collected from healthy volunteer
  subjects at rest and under controlled sedation
Description: This dataset of electrodermal activity was collected from 11 healthy
  volunteer subjects who were awake and at rest in seated position and 11 different
  healthy volunteers who were under controlled propofol sedation. For the awake and
  at rest subjects, the activity was recorded from each subject&#39;s non-dominant
  hand for one hour at 256 Hz. For the controlled propofol sedation subjects, the
  activity was recorded from each subject&#39;s left hand for about 3-4 hours at 500
  Hz.  From the raw data, EDA pulses were extracted and the pulse times and amplitudes
  reported. Electrodermal activity measures changing electrical conductance of the
  skin as an indicator of sweat gland activity. Sweat glands are a primitive part
  of the fight-or-flight response. These data were collected as part of a larger study
  to understand and build computational models for autonomic nervous system activity
  (including electrodermal activity) with approval from the Massachusetts Institute
  of Technology Committee on the Use of Humans as Experimental Subjects (COUHES) and
  the Massachusetts General Hospital Human Research Committee.
