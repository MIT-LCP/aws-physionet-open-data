Name: Cerebral Haemodynamic Autoregulatory Information System GUI
Description: 'Acute Brain injury (ABI) is a devastating event requiring intensive
  acute treatment and post-injury rehabilitation, both delivered for indeterminate
  periods of time. For severe ABIs, acute treatment is aimed at stabilizing the patient
  to prevent secondary brain injury from ischemia and swelling. This requires a balance
  between adequate levels of cerebral blood flow and safely low intracranial pressure
  (ICP) - a task normally done by autoregulatory (AR) processes of the brain.


  In the absence of normal AR, hemodynamic stability is difficult to maintain because
  there are no reliable predictors to guide treatment. Thus, guidelines for triage
  and discharge are somewhat arbitrary for ABI and the need for a Clinical Decision
  Support (CDS) system for neurotrauma is widely recognized. Prerequisite to a CDS
  is a large database of patient records and efficient means to extract meaningful
  information from them.


  CHARIS will systematize the analysis of relevant physiological signals, and will
  embody data-driven algorithms to search for potential predictors of acute clinical
  events.'
