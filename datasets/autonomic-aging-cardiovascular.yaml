Name: 'Autonomic Aging: A dataset to quantify changes of cardiovascular autonomic
  function during healthy aging'
Description: Autonomic function regulating blood pressure and cardiac rhythm progressively
  declines with increasing age. Impaired cardiovascular control promotes a variety
  of age-related conditions such as dementia, or Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease. This study
  aims to provide a database of high-resolution biological signals to describe the
  effect of healthy aging on cardiovascular regulation. Electrocardiogram and continuous
  non-invasive blood pressure signals were recorded simultaneously at rest in 1,121
  healthy volunteers.&nbsp;
