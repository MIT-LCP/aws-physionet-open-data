Name: Is the normal heart rate chaotic?
Description: In its June 2008 issue, the editors of Chaos announced a new feature,
  &quot;Controversial Topics in Nonlinear Dynamics&quot;. The first controversial
  topic to be aired is &quot;Is the Normal Heart Rate Chaotic?&quot;.&nbsp;Since major
  impediments to achieving consensus on the statistical properties of biologic time
  series have included the lack of open access time series, PhysioNet has provided
  a set of 15 heart beat (RR-interval) time series in health and disease (congestive
  heart failure and atrial fibrillation). Each time series is about 24 hours long
  (roughly 100,000 intervals), and is provided as a text file for analysis and as
  an image for visual review. All of the time series were derived from continuous
  ambulatory (Holter) electrocardiograms. We encourage participants in the Chaos Controversies
  issue to use the 15 RR interval time series provided here as a common focus of analysis.&nbsp;
