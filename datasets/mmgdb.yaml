Name: MMG Database
Description: This database contains uterine magnetomyographic (MMG) signals recorded
  using the 151 channel SARA (SQUID Array for Reproductive Assessment) system installed
  at UAMS, Little Rock, USA. Recordings are taken from 25 subjects who presented themselves
  in the Triage unit of Labor and Delivery and were undergoing monitoring and evaluation
  of labor. All subjects were asked to lean forward and sit comfortably with the sensor
  array covering their pregnant abdomens. The duration of a recording was typically
  around 20 minutes.
