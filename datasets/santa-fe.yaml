Name: Santa Fe Time Series Competition Data Set B
Description: This is a multivariate data set recorded from a patient in the sleep
  laboratory of the Beth Israel Hospital (now the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center)
  in Boston, Massachusetts. This data set was extracted from record slp60 of the MIT-BIH
  Polysomnographic Database, and it was submitted to the Santa Fe Time Series Competition
  in 1991 by our group. The data are presented in text form and have been split into
  two sequential parts. Each line contains simultaneous samples of three parameters;
  the interval between samples in successive lines is 0.5 seconds. The first column
  is the heart rate, the second is the chest volume (respiration force), and the third
  is the blood oxygen concentration (measured by ear oximetry). The sampling frequency
  for each measurement is 2 Hz (i.e., the time interval between measurements in successive
  rows is 0.5 seconds).
