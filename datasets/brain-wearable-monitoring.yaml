Name: Regulation of Brain Cognitive States through Auditory, Gustatory, and Olfactory
  Stimulation with Wearable Monitoring
Description: Inspired by advances in wearable technologies, we design and perform
  human-subject experiments to investigate the impacts of applying safe actuation
  (i.e., auditory, gustatory, and olfactory) for the purpose of regulating the cognitive
  arousal state and enhancing the performance state.&nbsp;In two separate experiments,
  participants are instructed to engage in a working memory task known as the&nbsp;n-back
  task. To modulate their brain state, we introduce various interventions, including
  listening to different genres of music in the first experiment, and consuming coffee
  and smelling perfume in the second experiment.&nbsp;Employing only wearable devices
  for human monitoring and using safe actuation intervention are the key components
  of the performed experiments. This dataset contains subjects&#39; correct/incorrect
  responses along with their reaction times. In these experiments, we employed two
  Empatica wristbands and one muse headband to collect their physiological data. The
  data from Empatica contains participants&#39;&nbsp;electrodermal activity (EDA),&nbsp;heart
  rate (HR),&nbsp;blood volume pulses (BVP),&nbsp;skin surface temperature,&nbsp;Photoplethysmography
  (PPG),&nbsp;and 3-axis&nbsp;accelerometer data.&nbsp;Using a muse headband, we also
  collected&nbsp;Electroencephalography&nbsp;(EEG) signals from four sensors. By creating
  a dataset that addresses the current lack of publicly available data for utilizing
  wearable devices and safe everyday stimuli to manage internal brain states, our
  research enables further investigations into machine learning and system identification.
  It eventually paves the way for smarter work environments in the future. The ultimate
  goal is to develop practical and automated personalized closed-loop systems that
  can effectively regulate internal brain states and enhance the overall quality of
  life.
