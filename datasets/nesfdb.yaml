Name: Noise Enhancement of Sensorimotor Function
Description: This database contains postural sway measurements for 15 healthy young
  (mean age 23, standard deviation 2), and 12 healthy elderly (mean age 73, standard
  deviation 3) volunteers. Each subject&#39;s postural sway was recorded during a
  test of 10 minutes for the young subjects, or 5 minutes for the elderly subjects,
  in all cases with a 2-minute seated break midway through the test. Each test was
  divided into 30-second trials, and each file of the database contains data for one
  of these 30-second trials.
