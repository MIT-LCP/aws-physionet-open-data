Name: Heart and lung segmentations for MIMIC-CXR/MIMIC-CXR-JPG and Montgomery County
  TB databases
Description: Segmenting the heart and lungs from chest X-ray images is essential for
  accurate disease diagnosis, enabling the calculation of image-derived digital biomarkers
  for cardiopulmonary health assessment. Furthermore, creation of annotated data sets
  can enhance development of machine learning applications in disease detection, reduce
  image noise for better clarity, or promote standardization for tracking disease
  progression or treatment effects. Generation of manual segmentations is time intensive
  process and it also requires access to trained medical professionals to verify the
  quality and accuracy of the scans. Originally made to train heart and lung segmentation/detection
  models for cardiomegaly diagnosis, the manual segmentations in this data paper are
  published here in hope of aiding development of AI models relating to heart and
  lungs identification in chest X-rays. This database presents the heart and lung
  segmentations for 200 semi-randomly chosen MIMIC-CXR/MIMIC-CXR-JPG posterior-anterior
  chest X-rays for the purpose of training detection and segmentation networks. Additionally,
  it contains the heart segmentations for the 138 posterior-anterior chest X-rays
  in the Montgomery Country tuberculosis database.
