Name: 'EPHNOGRAM: A Simultaneous Electrocardiogram and Phonocardiogram Database'
Description: 'The electro-phono-cardiogram (EPHNOGRAM) project focused on the development
  of low-cost and low-power devices for recording simultaneous electrocardiogram (ECG)
  and phonocardiogram (ECG) data, with auxiliary channels for capturing environmental
  audio noise, which could be used for PCG quality enhancement through signal processing.
  The current database, recorded by version 2.1 of the developed hardware, has been
  acquired from 24 healthy adults aged between 23 and 29 (average: 25.4 &plusmn; 1.9
  years) in 30min stress-test sessions during resting, walking, running and biking
  conditions, using indoor fitness center equipment. The dataset also contains several
  30s sample records acquired during rest conditions. This data is useful for simultaneous
  multi-modal analysis of ECG and PCG. It provides interesting insights into the inter-relationship
  between the mechanical and electrical mechanisms of the heart, under rest and physical
  activity.'
