Name: MIMIC-IV Waveform Database
Description: 'The MIMIC-IV Waveform Database is a large collection of physiological
  signals and measurements from patients in intensive care units, including electrocardiograms,
  photoplethysmograms, respiration, invasive and non-invasive blood pressure, and
  more. These measurements and signals are obtained directly from the bedside monitor,
  and provide a detailed view into the physiology of critically ill patients.


  Combining this database with the clinical information found in MIMIC-IV provides
  a broad, cross-sectional example of the data available to caregivers in a modern
  ICU. We hope that this database will provide a foundation for future improvements
  to monitoring technology as well as data-driven diagnosis and treatment.'
