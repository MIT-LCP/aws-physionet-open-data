Name: Evoked Auditory Responses in Normals
Description: 'This database, created and contributed by Michael J. Epstein and Ikaro
  Silva, was generated as part of a study examining evoked potentials and loudness
  growth. The database consists of two sets of physiological signals: auditory brainstem
  response (ABR) and otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and two sets of psychoacoustical
  estimates of loudness as a function of peak sound pressure level (peSPL).'
