Name: Non-Invasive Fetal ECG Arrhythmia Database
Description: 'Fetal cardiac arrhythmias are defined as any irregular fetal cardiac
  rhythm or regular rhythm at a rate outside the reference range of 100 to 200 beat
  per minute (bpm). Arrhythmias are discovered in about 1% of fetuses with about 10%
  of these being considered potential sources of morbidity. Although most fetal arrhythmias
  are benign, some can cause fetal hydrops and lead to fetal death. This means that
  up to 1 fetus in 100 need their arrhythmias to be closely monitored and if indicated
  treated in-utero using antiarrhythmic therapy.


  The Non-Invasive Fetal ECG Arrhythmia Database (NIFEA DB) provides a series of fetal
  arrhythmias recordings (n=12) and a number of control normal rhythm recordings (n=14)
  performed using the non-invasive fetal electrocardiography (NI-FECG) technique.'
