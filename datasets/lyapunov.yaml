Name: A practical method for calculating Lyapunov exponents from small data sets
Description: Detecting the presence of chaos in a dynamical system is an important
  problem that is solved by measuring the largest Lyapunov exponent. Lyapunov exponents
  quantify the exponential divergence of initially close state-space trajectories
  and estimate the amount of chaos in a system.
