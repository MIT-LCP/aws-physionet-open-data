Name: 'R-DECO: An open-source Matlab based graphical user interface for the detection
  and correction of R-peaks'
Description: 'Many of the existing ECG toolboxes focus on the derivation of heart
  rate variability features from RR-intervals. By doing so, they assume correct detection
  of the QRS-complexes. However, it is highly likely that not all detections are correct.
  Therefore, it is recommended to visualize the actual R-peak positions in the ECG
  signal and allow manual adaptations.


  As a solution, we present R-DECO, an easy-to-use graphical user interface for the
  detection and correction of R-peaks. Within R-DECO, the R-peaks are detected by
  an adaptation of the Pan-Tompkins algorithm. Instead of using all the pre-processing
  steps of the latter algorithm, the proposed algorithm uses only an envelope-based
  procedure to flatten the ECG and enhance the QRS-complexes. The algorithm obtained
  an overall sensitivity of 99.60% and positive predictive value of 99.69% on the
  MIT/BIH arrhythmia database. Additionally, R-DECO includes support for several input
  data formats for ECG signals, three basic filters, the possibility to load other
  R-peak locations and intuitive methods to correct ectopic, wrong, or missed heartbeats.
  All functionalities can be accessed via the graphical user interface and the analysis
  results can be exported as Matlab or Excel files.&nbsp;


  Through its easy-to-use-graphical user interface, R-DECO allows both clinicians
  and researchers to use all functionalities, without previous knowledge. R-DECO has
  been developed on Windows 10 using Matlab 2018a. GUIDE, MATLAB&rsquo;s GUI development
  environment, was used&nbsp;to design the GUI of R-DECO. It has been tested and&nbsp;proven
  to be functional for older&nbsp;Matlab versions going back to Matlab 2016a.'
