Name: Clinical data from the MIMIC-II database for a case study on indwelling arterial
  catheters
Description: This dataset was created for the purpose of&nbsp;a case study in the&nbsp;book:&nbsp;Secondary
  Analysis of Electronic Health Records, published by Springer in 2016. In particular,
  the dataset was used throughout Chapter 16 (Data Analysis) by Raffa J. et al. to
  investigate the effectiveness of indwelling arterial catheters in hemodynamically
  stable patients with respiratory failure for mortality outcomes. The dataset is
  derived from MIMIC-II, the&nbsp;publicly-accessible critical care database. It contains
  summary&nbsp;clinical data and&nbsp; outcomes for 1,776 patients.
