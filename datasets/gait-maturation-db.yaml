Name: Gait Maturation Database
Description: 'The data contained here are from 50 healthy children ranging in age
  from 40 months to 163 months. Each data file is named with a subject identifier
  (1-50) and the subject&#39;s age (e.g., the file name 2-45.txt indicates that subject
  #2 is 45 months old). Each data file contains two columns of data in text format.
  The first column is the time (in seconds), and the second column is the stride interval
  (in seconds) or the gait cycle duration, the time from heel strike to heel strike
  of the same foot.'
