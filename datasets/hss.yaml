Name: Logistic Regression-HSMM-based Heart Sound Segmentation
Description: The identification of the exact positions of the first and second heart
  sounds within a phonocardiogram (PCG), or heart sound segmentation, is an essential
  step in the automatic analysis of heart sound recordings, allowing for the classification
  of pathological events. While threshold-based segmentation methods have shown modest
  success, probabilistic models, such as hidden Markov models, have recently been
  shown to surpass the capabilities of previous methods. Segmentation performance
  is further improved when apriori information about the expected duration of the
  states is incorporated into the model, such as in a hidden semi-Markov model (HSMM).
  This code provides Matlab algorithms to perform&nbsp;HSMM-based heart sound segmentation.
