Name: 'Heart Murmur Detection from Phonocardiogram Recordings: The George B. Moody
  PhysioNet Challenge 2022'
Description: 'Congenital heart diseases affect about 1% of newborns, representing
  an important morbidity and mortality factor for several severe conditions, including
  advanced heart failure [1]. In a 2019 survey, it was estimated that congenital heart
  diseases affect over 500,000 children in East Africa [2], and about 8 in every 1000
  live births [3]. Acquired heart diseases include rheumatic fever and the Kawasaki
  disease, the former being a serious public health problem in developing regions,
  e.g., rural Brazil [4]. Several regions of developing countries have difficulties
  in diagnosing and treating both congenital and acquired heart conditions in children.
  This is mainly due to the lack of infrastructure and cardiology specialists in geographically
  large areas and difficulty in accessing health services. In addition, the current
  COVID-19 pandemic poses new difficulties in the clinical evaluation of patients
  by delaying important in-person patient-doctor contacts, negatively impacting screening
  and monitoring activities.


  A non-invasive assessment of the mechanical function of the heart, performed at
  point-of-care settings, can provide early information regarding congenital and acquired
  heart diseases in children. The lack of early diagnoses of these conditions represents
  a major public health problem, especially in underprivileged countries with high
  birth rates [5,&nbsp;6,&nbsp;7]. In particular, cardiac auscultation and the analysis
  of the phonocardiogram (PCG) can unveil fundamental clinical information regarding
  heart malfunctioning caused by congenital and acquired heart disease in pediatric
  populations. This is achieved by detecting abnormal sound waves, or heart murmurs,
  in the PCG signal. Murmurs are abnormal waves generated by turbulent blood flow
  in cardiac and vascular structures. They are closely associated with specific diseases
  such as septal defects, failure of ductus arteriosus closure in newborns, and defective
  cardiac valves.


  Succedent the&nbsp;2016 Challenge, which focused on classifying normal vs. abnormal
  heart sounds&nbsp;from a single short recording from a single precordial location&nbsp;[8,&nbsp;9],
  this year&rsquo;s Challenge is devoted to detecting the presence or absence of murmurs&nbsp;from
  multiple heart sound recordings from multiple auscultation locations, as well as
  detecting the clinical outcomes.'
