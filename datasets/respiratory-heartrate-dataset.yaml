Name: Respiratory and heart rate monitoring dataset from aeration study
Description: 'A study was conducted to collect respiratory pressure and flow data
  for model-based assessment, alongside electrical impedance tomography (EIT) aeration,
  electrocardiogram (ECG), and heart-rate belt (HRB) data. A 20 subjects set was selected
  with no known significant respiratory abnormalities, under University of Canterbury
  Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC) consent (HREC 2023/30/LR-PS). Subject demographic
  data was collected using a combination of measurements and a self-reported questionnaire.
  Subject demographic information to ascertain: sex; height; weight; age; any history
  of asthma, smoking, or vaping; and approximate thoracic cage and breast tissue volumes.
  The trial was setup with subjects breathing through the pressure and flowmeter using
  a full-face mask and filter. Inspiratory and expiratory flow were separated using
  one-way valves for measurement purposes and both ports were rapidly occluded every
  200ms to generate passive mechanics assessment intervals. A continuous positive
  airway pressure (CPAP) machine was used to provide positive airway pressure (PEEP)
  in series with the inspiratory port. Three trials were conducted per subject. Two
  of which, involved increasing PEEP (0, 4, and 8 cmH2O), and in one of which subjects
  were asked to perform two 10s breath holds at each level. The third was a recording
  of three forced expiratory manoeuvres (FEM). These tests were conducted to provide
  an initial comparison of current respiratory techniques to model-based methods,
  which aims to inform the design of future clinical testing on subjects with known
  respiratory abnormalities.'
