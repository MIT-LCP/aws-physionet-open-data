Name: Brno University of Technology ECG Signal Database with Annotations of P Wave
  (BUT PDB)
Description: Brno University of Technology ECG Signal Database with Annotations of
  P Wave (BUT PDB) is an ECG signal database with marked peaks of P waves created
  by the cardiology team at the Department of Biomedical Engineering, Brno University
  of Technology. The database consists of 50 2-minute 2-lead ECG signal records with
  various types of pathology. The ECGs were selected from three&nbsp;existing databases
  of ECG signal - the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database, the MIT-BIH Supraventricular Arrhythmia
  Database,&nbsp;and the Long Term AF Database. The P waves positions were manually
  annotated by two ECG experts in all 50 records. Each record contains also annotation
  of positions and types of QRS complexes (from original database) and dominant diagnosis
  (pathology) present in record. This database is created for the development, evaluation
  and objective comparison of P wave detection algorithms.
