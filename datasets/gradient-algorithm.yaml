Name: Gradient Algorithm
Description: In finding an optimal stimulus waveform for inducing switches in neuronal
  states, analytical techniques from optimal control theory are often found to be
  difficult to use or extremely time intensive. Here, we present the code for a gradient-based
  algorithm approach that has been used to find energetically optimal stimulus waveforms
  to trigger an action potential in the Hodgkin-Huxley model as well as initiating
  and repressing repetitive firing in the FitzHugh-Nagumo models. These two models
  serve just as examples and the code can be easily adapted to any other system.
