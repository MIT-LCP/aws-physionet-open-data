Name: Eye Tracking Dataset for the 12-Lead Electrocardiogram Interpretation of Medical
  Practitioners and Students
Description: 'This dataset contains&nbsp;collected eye tracking data from medical
  practitioners and students&nbsp;with different expertise levels&nbsp;to understand
  their electrocardiogram interpretation behavior. These medical practitioners encounter
  electrocardiograms during their daily medical practice. The end goal of the collection
  of this dataset was to use it for analysis to uncover insights about key best practices
  as well as pitfall in the ECG interpretation process.&nbsp;The data consists of
  quantitative eye tracking measurements for different eye gaze features for 63 participants.
  These participants belong to six expertise categories, namely: medical students,
  nurses, technicians, residents, fellows and finally consultants. Each one of these
  participants contributed to the data collection by interpreting ten different electrocardiograms.
  The eye tracking data includes the eye fixations count and duration, the eye gaze
  duration, and finally the fixations revisitations.&nbsp;It was collected at 60 frames
  per second using a Tobii Pro X2-60. Each participant was allowed a timeframe of
  30 seconds to interpret each one of the ten ECGs. &nbsp;The collected data was processed
  taking into consideration two defined area of interest distributions. This enabled
  the extraction of metrics specifically tailored for the 12-lead electrocardiogram. '
