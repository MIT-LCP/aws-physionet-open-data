Name: Simultaneous physiological measurements with five devices at different cognitive
  and physical loads
Description: This open database contains physiological measurements from 13 adult
  and healthy subjects during a standardized experimental setup. The physiology was
  examined with five different devices (NeXus-10 MKII,&nbsp;eMotion Faros 360&deg;,
  SOMNOtouch NIBP, Hexoskin Hx1, Polar RS800 Multi), which, in contrast to other studies,
  were recorded simultaneously. The experiment included a five minute baseline measurement,
  five minute walking on the treadmill, a five minute cognitive audio test, and a
  five minute uphill walking on the treadmill. Measurements included electrocardiography
  (ECG), photoplethysmography, accelerometry, oxygen saturation, respiration, heart
  rate, heart rate variability, and RR intervals sampled between 1 Hz and 8000 Hz.
  The dataset was originally generated during an investigation of functionality, accuracy,
  and usability of several ECG-measurement devices. This resource included the complete
  raw data files (EDF and HRM) and merged data with a manual expert annotation of
  heart beats and annotation files with information about the beginning of each experimental
  phase.
