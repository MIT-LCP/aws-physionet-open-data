Name: PADS - Parkinsons Disease Smartwatch dataset
Description: Parkinson&rsquo;s disease (PD) is the second-most common neurodegenerative
  disorder, while incidence and worldwide burden are further increasing. In the era
  of digital health transformation, smart devices and mobile sensors, including smartphones
  and smartwatches, can provide an affordable source to capture and analyse digital
  objective biomarkers. These can aid in early diagnosis and studying phenotypical
  characteristics. The Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease Smartwatch (PADS) dataset comprises
  clinical assessments of a broad spectrum of PD patients, other similar movement
  disorders and healthy controls. The assessments were recorded using a smart-device-based
  system consisting of two smartwatches and one smartphone. The two smartwatches were
  worn on each of the patient&rsquo;s wrists and their sensors synchronously recorded
  11 interactive movement tasks that were designed by expert neurologists to provoke
  subtle changes in movement pathologies. In total, 5159 measurement steps of 469
  individuals were captured. The PADS dataset includes all acceleration and rotation
  sensor signals, as well as details on movement steps, demographics, medical history,
  and PD-specific non-motor symptoms. We believe that our extensively annotated dataset
  provides a well-suited data foundation for the training, validation, and optimisation
  of future technology- and sensor-driven systems for movement disorders.
