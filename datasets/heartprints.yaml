Name: Heartprints - A Dynamical Portrait of Cardiac Arrhythmia
Description: As part of an effort to visualize and to understand the dynamics of cardiac
  arrhythmias with frequent ventricular ectopy, we have developed a new representational
  technique termed &quot;heartprints.&quot; These heartprints are a combination of
  seven histograms generated from an annotated record of heartbeat time intervals.
