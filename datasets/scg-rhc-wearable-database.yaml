Name: 'SCG-RHC: Wearable Seismocardiogram Signal and Right Heart Catheter Database'
Description: We are providing an open access dataset of 73 patients to study better
  ways to monitor changes in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and pulmonary capillary
  wedge pressure (PCWP) using a small, non-invasive, chest-worn wearable patch. The
  ground truth PAP and PCWP were measured using pulmonary artery wedge catheter during
  the standard Right Heart Catheter (RHC) procedure, and they were modulated by infusing
  systemic vasodilators. The wearable data including electrocardiogram (ECG) and tri-axial
  seismocardiogram (SCG) were also measured simultaneously and time synchronized to
  the ground truth data. Besides waveform records, this dataset also contains demographic
  data such as sex, age, weight, height, heart failure status, etc.) and other RHC
  values such as right atrial pressure, right ventricular pressure, stroke volume,
  and cardiac output.
