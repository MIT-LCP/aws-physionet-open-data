Name: 'AF Classification from a Short Single Lead ECG Recording: The PhysioNet/Computing
  in Cardiology Challenge 2017'
Description: The 2017 PhysioNet/CinC Challenge aims to encourage the development of
  algorithms to classify, from a single short ECG lead recording (between 30 s and
  60 s in length), whether the recording shows normal sinus rhythm, atrial fibrillation
  (AF), an alternative rhythm, or is too noisy to be classified.
