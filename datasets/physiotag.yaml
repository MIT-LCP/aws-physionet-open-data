Name: 'PhysioTag: An Open-Source Platform for Collaborative Annotation of Physiological
  Waveforms'
Description: 'To develop robust algorithms for automated diagnosis of medical conditions
  such as cardiac arrhythmias, researchers require large collections of data with
  human expert annotations. Currently, there is a lack of accessible, open-source
  platforms for human experts to collaboratively develop these annotated datasets
  through a web interface. In this work, we developed a flexible, generalizable, web-based
  framework to enable multiple users to create and share annotations on multi-channel
  physiological waveforms. The software is simple to install and offers a range of
  features, including: user management and task customization; a programmatic interface
  for data import and export; and a leaderboard for annotation progress tracking.'
