Name: AHA Database Sample Excluded Record
Description: The files available here are not part of the AHA Database. The 0001.*
  and 0201.* files have been derived from a sample given to us in 1980 by the creators
  of the AHA Database. The original recording had been a candidate for inclusion in
  the database and was digitized and annotated using the same methods used for the
  AHA Database records. After the annotation process was complete, the recording was
  excluded from the AHA Database since it was found to contain ectopy of a higher
  grade than the class for which it had been chosen as a candidate.
