Name: Open Access Dataset and Toolbox of High-Density Surface Electromyogram Recordings
Description: 'We provide an open access dataset of High densitY Surface Electromyogram
  (HD-sEMG) Recordings (named &quot;Hyser&quot;). We acquired data from 20 subjects
  with each subject participating in our experiment twice on separate days following
  the same experiment paradigm. Our Hyser dataset contains five sub-datasets: (1)
  pattern recognition (PR) dataset acquired during 34 hand gestures, (2) maximal voluntary
  muscle contraction (MVC) dataset while subjects contracted each individual finger,
  (3) one-degree of freedom (DoF) dataset acquired during force-varying contraction
  of each individual finger, (4) N-DoF dataset acquired during prescribed contractions
  of combinations of multiple fingers, and (5) random task dataset acquired during
  random contraction of combinations of fingers without any prescribed force trajectory.
  Sub-dataset 1 can be used for gesture recognition studies. Sub-datasets 2-5 also
  recorded individual finger forces, thus can be used for studies on proportional
  control of neuroprostheses.'
