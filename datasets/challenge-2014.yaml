Name: 'Robust Detection of Heart Beats in Multimodal Data: The PhysioNet/Computing
  in Cardiology Challenge 2014'
Description: This challenge aims to encourage the exploration of robust methods for
  locating heart beats in continuous long-term data from bedside monitors and similar
  devices that record not only ECG but usually other physiologic signals as well,
  including pulsatile signals that directly reflect cardiac activity, and other signals
  that may have few or no observable markers of heart beats. Our goal is to accelerate
  development of open-source research tools that can reliably, efficiently, and automatically
  analyze data such as that contained in the MIMIC II Waveform Database, making use
  of all relevant information.
