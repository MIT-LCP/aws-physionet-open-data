Name: Long-term Recordings of Gait Dynamics
Description: "Stride interval fluctuations were studied in ten young, healthy men.\
  \ Participants had no history of any neuromuscular, respiratory or cardiovascular\
  \ disorders, and were taking no medications. Mean age was 21.7 years (range: 18-29\
  \ years). Height was 1.77 &plusmn; 0.08 meters (mean &plusmn; S.D.) and weight was\
  \ 71.8 &plusmn; 10.7 kg. All subjects provided informed written consent.\r\n\r\n\
  Subjects walked continuously on level ground around an obstacle free, long (either\
  \ 225 or 400 meters), approximately oval path and the stride interval was measured\
  \ using ultra-thin, force sensitive switches taped inside one shoe."
