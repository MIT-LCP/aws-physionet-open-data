Name: 'RR Interval Time Series Modeling: The PhysioNet/Computing in Cardiology Challenge
  2002'
Description: 'We are pleased to announce the third in our annual series of challenges
  from PhysioNet and Computers in Cardiology. We received many suggestions for challenge
  topics, and encourage you to  write to us with further suggestions. We chose the
  topic for this year&#39;s challenge not only for its intrinsic interest, but also
  because it is quite different from the previous two challenges.


  Heart rate variability has attracted much attention from researchers since the early
  1980s. It has long been understood that a metronomic heart rate is pathological,
  and that the healthy heart is influenced by multiple neural and hormonal inputs
  that result in variations in interbeat (RR) intervals, at time scales ranging from
  less than a second to 24 hours. Even after 20 years of study, new analytic techniques
  continue to reveal properties of the time series of RR intervals. Much research
  in this area aims to discover or to explain how specific changes in variability
  can be related to specific pathologies.


  Given how much is known about heart rate variability, it might be thought that simulating
  a realistic sequence of RR intervals would be an easy task. The intricate interdependencies
  of variations at different scales, however, make it difficult to create a simulation
  of sufficient realism to mislead an experienced observer, and it may be even harder
  to deceive a program designed to quantify these subtle features.'
