Name: 'Electrocardiographic Imaging of Myocardial Infarction: The PhysioNet/Computing
  in Cardiology Challenge 2007'
Description: The aim of Challenge 2007 is to establish how well one can characterize
  the location and extent of moderate to large, relatively compact infarcts using
  electrocardiographic evidence (supplemented by a model of the torso geometry and
  conductivity), in comparison with a &quot;gold standard&quot; expert analysis of
  gadolinium-enhanced MRI data.
