Name: Software for computing Heart Rate Fragmentation
Description: 'Heart rate fragmentation (HRF) is a new method for assessing neuroautonomic
  integrity based on the analysis of short-term (high-frequency [HF]) heart rate dynamics.
  The code (in AWK) provided here is for the computation of three different metrics,
  PIP, PNNLS, and PNNSS introduced in 2017 by Costa and colleagues.&nbsp;


  The motivation for developing HRF was the recognition that changes in heart rate
  (HR) above the respiratory frequency not only inflate the value of traditional heart
  rate variability (HRV) metrics, such as rMSSD and HF power, but are a dynamical
  marker of cardioautonomic dysfunction.


  In healthy subjects, HR increases with inspiration and decreases with expiration,
  defining a &ldquo;high-frequency&rdquo; pattern referred to as respiratory sinus
  arrhythmia. This physiologic oscillation is driven primarily by changes in vagal
  tone. In contexts in which cardio-respiratory coupling is degraded, e.g., with aging
  and disease, non-vagally mediated oscillations whose frequencies are higher than
  the breathing frequency may develop. Non-vagally mediated fluctuations are characterized
  by an excess of reversals in HR acceleration. The simplest measure of HRF is the
  percentage of &ldquo;inflection points,&rdquo; (PIP) i.e., of changes in HR acceleration
  sign. Of key importance is fact that traditional short-term HRV measures can be
  high for two opposite reasons, one healthy &ndash; respiratory sinus arrhythmia
  &ndash; consistent with high vagal tone modulation, and one pathologic &ndash; fragmented
  rhythms &ndash; consistent with decreased/impaired vagal activity.


  Increased HRF has been shown to be independently associated with higher risk of
  incident major adverse cardiovascular events and atrial fibrillation. These results
  have been independently confirmed, as described in Background section.'
