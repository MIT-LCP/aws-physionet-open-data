Name: MGH/MF Waveform Database
Description: The Massachusetts General Hospital/Marquette Foundation (MGH/MF) Waveform
  Database is a comprehensive collection of electronic recordings of hemodynamic and
  electrocardiographic waveforms of stable and unstable patients in critical care
  units, operating rooms, and cardiac catheterization laboratories. It is the result
  of a collaboration between physicians, biomedical engineers and nurses at the Massachusetts
  General Hospital. The database consists of recordings from 250 patients and represents
  a broad spectrum of physiologic and pathophysiologic states. Individual recordings
  vary in length from 12 to 86 minutes, and in most cases are about an hour long.
