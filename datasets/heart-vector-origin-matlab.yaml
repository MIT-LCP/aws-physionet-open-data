Name: Heart Vector Origin Point Detection and Time-Coherent Median Beat Construction
Description: 'An appropriate selection of the heart vector origin point defines the
  ECG&rsquo;s baseline, which then affects all subsequent ECG measurements. We introduce
  software capable of automatically identifying the heart vector origin point and
  constructing&nbsp;a time-coherent median beat. We define the heart vector electrocardiographic
  (VCG) origin point based on its electrophysiological and biophysical meaning: the
  electrically quiet, or isoelectric state of the heart when the heart vector does
  not move in 3D space. The electrically silent period is defined as the segment between
  the end of repolarization and the onset of P-wave (if present), or the beginning
  of the QRS complex.


  The definition of the VCG origin point determines the definition of the vector magnitude
  ECG baseline. Vector-Magnitude that is zeroed at the origin of the heart vector
  provides the most physiologically accurate cardiac beat. This is a fundamental step
  for any further global ECG and VCG measurements. Time-coherent median beat preserves
  the physiological sequence of cardiac activation and recovery. The time-coherent
  approach takes an easily detectable fiducial point (maximum |dV/dt|)&nbsp; as detected
  only on one ECG lead (e.g., X). Corresponding time-points on two other leads (e.g.,
  Y and Z) are taken regardless of their morphological features. Such an approach
  significantly reduces the chance of error and preserves the physiological sequence
  of cardiac activation and recovery. The algorithm requires an input of a 10-second
  raw digital orthogonal ECG signal (XYZ leads).'
